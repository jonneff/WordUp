(they would for instance get $100 per car for selling between 10-20 cars, but $150 per car for selling over 30 making them try and hit the higher bracket). if you have some time, follow a posting online or otherwise, the longer a car sits on a dealers lot, the more they try and get rid of them. if cars dont sell, they are often sent to auction, costing the dealer $$ and making less on auction than selling it on the cheap.',\n",
