"Play the ""what would I do with unlimited money?"" game. Just write a list of everything you would do with unlimited funds. Do this at least a couple times a week. First, it'll show you your immediate thought patterns. Second, it'll show you what you're resisting in your life by forcing you to think, ""should I write this down? I hate it that I think I'll never get this,"" etc. This is deeply transformative. 

Doing this exercise, especially a series of 3-10 times in a month, will reveal a lot. It will upgrade the quality of your questions, from ""what should I do with this hotel time?"" to ""how can I move toward X goal in my current situation?"" And honestly, depending on how wild your dreams become, the best use of time might be reading books. You can learn a LOT, about any industry, by crushing half a book in 5 hours. Then you'll be thinking about that stuff constantly, which will lead you to the next best use of time, and within a couple of months that first goal will be within your reach. 

Knowing precisely what you want - the process of that - tends to make you lucky. Interesting ""coincidences"" start happening to open doors for you, just because you're more aware of those little openings and chances when they come along.

"We just wanted to wait until we got married - actually, I guess we moved in together a month before we got married simply because of leasing issues so I guess I should address that technicality.  Yes, there were times that we spent the night together while we were dating.  But it was my space or hers - which is exactly why so many people on here are advocating that you live with your partner to see the compatibility flesh out.  I'm just advocating that you don't need to live with someone to know if it's going to be a good idea in the long run.  If you truly love someone you can make it work (and when I say love, I'm talking about what I think is part of that definition, which is patience and respect towards your partner).  You are definitely naive if you think (and I'm not directing this at you) you can just get married and move in and make it work.



As getting married is one of the biggest decisions of ones' life, we wanted to take it very seriously having seen fallout not only in our own previous relationships, but with our friends as well.  So counseling was a premeditated approach to the reality of getting married and combining lives.



Honestly, we had no idea of wide of breadth the counseling would cover.  I remember we were giving this little book of questions (and I say little because I recall it being so small), but in it were so many questions of topics to discuss that we would end up spending hours going over like a dozen questions.


I have no idea how other premarital counseling sessions work, but ours was very real and honest about the ins and outs of marriage.  At the end of the day, one of the biggest takeaways was that you have to communicate and do it often.  I think these days people do find this out by trial and error (moving in), but there is the alternative that we went through that I think is just as, if not more effective as we learned the root ways to handle the upcoming trials and tribulations of marriage.

Here is what I would add- at $1,500, the condition of the vehicle is far more important than the make and model (still wouldn't recommend European cars at this price range). That is to say, you're far better off with a seemingly shitty Chevy Cavalier owned by a little old lady with new tires and impeccable service records than a Honda Civic with many problems owned by a 22 year old without the money to maintain it. There are PLENTY of good cars with blue book values at $1,500. The trick is to find one that has been maintained well. Remember, maintenance adds very very little to the blue book value of a car (i.e. a ""fair"" rated car is valued barely lower than an ""very good"" rated car).  Good condition cars are out there if you're patient. ",null,null,null,Tidley_Wink,null,null,1448318411,t5_2qstm,t3_3tzpix,t3_3tzpix,36,1449981329,0,0,cxaol5y,personalfinance,36,null,null

Not saying that they aren't in a financial crisis, but using net worth like this is stupid. Cash flow is what's important and it's long term sustainability otherwise the argument is that a homeless person is much better off than a family that gets a reasonable mortgage.

The rule as I was taught early on is ""the first company trains you, the next one pays more for you because they don't have to"". This has certainly been my personal experience. After working a professional job for 5 years through many promotions I was stuck making &lt;$55k. I shopped around and ended up moving to another city for a 50% pay increase, which has continued to improve over the years beyond what I ever expected.

You are lucky that you were employed for so long during the recession to get this experience, now it is time to take it elsewhere and work for someone who values your talent.

I used to work for a car rental company.  There very well could have been a chance they couldn't change the price instead of them simply being stubborn about it.  Was the vehicle booked and paid for on a 3rd party website like travelocity?  If that is the case you didn't actually pay Hertz.  You paid the site and they pay Hertz which is why they are not flexible on the price.  They absolutely should have had the right vehicle for you though and you have the right not to accept the Ford Flex or demand they switch you out into a suitable vehicle.

"Pasting Whole Life Insurance Cons for those interested:

------------------------

 WLI Cons
---

* WLI premiums are expensive. While TLI will run you on the order of hundreds of dollars per year, WLI will cost you a full order of magnitude more (thousands per year). In addition to the up-front cost of expensive premiums, you get hit on the back end by investment fees that you otherwise don't really need to be paying. These fees go into the insurance company's pocket, not yours.

* WLI is permanent - but people's needs for life insurance often aren't permanent. I'll go into more detail soon.

* Like the dwarves of Moria, ""You cannot get out."" ...without paying a hefty surrender fee, that is. The costs of surrendering a WLI policy can run into the tens of thousands of dollars, up in smoke.",null,null,null,InternetUser007,null,null,1447446910,t5_2qstm,t3_3soppn,t1_cwz3iy3,21,1449784286,0,0,cwz9psw,personalfinance,21,null,null

"You can argue forever about whether a Ford Edge is technically a luxury car or not, but Hertz (and all agencies) have firm letter-based class designations for the vehicles they rent, just like an airline sells Y class, M class, K class, etc. tickets.

If the letter is the same you are out of luck. If the letter is different, take it up with the Hertz station manager. Disputing the charge is an extreme step and could boomerang back against you if you were billed the same class as booked.

First of all it stems from a general misconception that taxes withheld=taxes owed and paid. If your getting a $500 bonus and are earring minimum wage you won't likely pay much or anything at the end of the year. Bonuses are withheld at the highest rate because unlike wages there is no easy way to estimate what tax bracket those earnings will fall into. So withhold and return rather than not withhold and leave the employee owing. 

But more importantly **it's a goddamn bonus.** most people don't get them and no one really gets them as part of their normal salary. It's a perk. It's extra. You were just handed cash that you didn't budget on and weren't (or at least shouldn't be) counting on. But woe is me because it isn't slightly bigger?

Go get yourself a secured credit card(credit card that you have to put a deposit on) and build your credit. Give it a year in that old junker again while you are building your credit and go get a 0% interest loan.

"I had this situation when I first came to the USA. I had no credit history and had trouble simply just opening a bank account. My loan was at 18% interest. While this is excessive, I appreciate the dealership actually getting me that loan since others flatly rejected me. 

I have co-incidentally been working as a software engineer on on many car dealership solutions (mostly data) over the past decade and have picked up on many tips to buying a car on the cheap.

Dealers actually don't always make big profit on selling you a specific car for a crazy price, they make way more money with service and screwing you on your trade-in. It's fairly easy to negotiate with dealers since they will do almost anything to secure your business, even if they only make a small profit on your transaction. I have negotiated 0% interest loans and $6K off cars (for myself and the wife) which is in the region of $20K.

Some other tips would be to know exactly what your trade-in is worth (using KBB or Edmunds, whichever is higher) and don't sell for less than 10-15% of that value (which will already be much more than what dealers offer you). Before going to a dealership, find your car on CarMax as a reference price and use it to haggle. CarMax don't really negotate and tend to have prices below what a normal dealer has.

Buy your car towards the end of the month or end of the year if possible, dealers very often have quotas they try to achieve to get OEM bonuses which sometimes makes financial sense for them to sell a car at a loss. (They would for instance get $100 per car for selling between 10-20 cars, but $150 per car for selling over 30 making them try and hit the higher bracket). 

If you have some time, follow a posting online or otherwise, the longer a car sits on a dealer's lot, the more they try and get rid of them. If cars don't sell, they are often sent to auction, costing the dealer $$ and making less on auction than selling it on the cheap.",null,null,null,poliphilosophy,null,null,1446680518,t5_2qstm,t3_3rj1bu,t1_cwopkme,19,1449603152,0,0,cworyyk,personalfinance,19,null,null

"Well idk what insurance you have. I had state farm and got in an accident in another state (not my fault). Got my car rear ended by some douche nozzle who did not have a proper hitch set up for the concrete mixer he was towing. The guy begged me not to report it to insurance and the cops lmao. I just laughed and said im not the gullible because there was barely any damage to his truck.

Turned out that my frame got bent just a little and repairs costed more than what it was worth (which is how an insurance adjuster has to handle it). Got a cool 7 grand for a car I paid 3200 for at an auction.

First wanna say glad everyone is ok, prolly dont go see that movie concussion when it comes out. Second, 80k miles is incredible for a 10yr old car. But that honestly depends on your state (in florida its not uncommon to have to drive 30 miles everyday for work). Depending on weather wear and all that which will be determined by either a certified auto adjuster or mechanic you should get very close to its actual worth, especially if its 1 owner (not uncommon for people in florida to get a little over since we dont have weather wear to snow and frigid temps). The 6k figure should be very real.

Also I strongly oppose getting a whole brand new car. You prolly just wanna use most of the money you get from the totalled check. Seems to me your emergency fund, although bigger than others, is still quite small and id prolly keep it at the cool 25k number. Used cars are not bad at all so long as you know what to look for.

Unless you do it full time, betting on single stocks is a great way to lose all your money. 

You can still earn decent returns by investing indexes, or even sector specific indexes with a fraction of the risk of a single stock. 

Don't bet like this, what you aren't willing to lose. TWTR has had a loss of about 26% over the course of 2 days earlier this year. If that happened right now, with your leveraged account, you'll have lost 50% of your money, and will likely have your margin account called, meaning you'll have to pay them back 100% immediately.

Here is where the whole scam thing lies. But wait, it doesn't sound so bad, right? Work your ass off, bring other people in, get payed a share of their work. What could go wrong?

What goes wrong is that the majority of people who joins this scams are not the good naive souls that we imagine them to be. They are douchebags that envision getting rich without doing anything for anyone. Their objective is not to work their ass off and sell the goods and maybe bring some of their hard working friends along. Their goal is to sell nothing and just recruit the largest amount of people they can, so they may rest on their laurels and collect other people earnings without puting in any work at all. By the way, this is exactly what your friend is trying to do to you right now.

You can quickly see how this gets pyramid shaped and useless if everyone this douchebag brings along also think this way (and they do), pretty soon no one is selling shit and just sitting home waiting for the money to come from everybody else. The only one actually making money is the top guy selling the packs of whatever products you are supposed to buy to be in the scam.

The reasons scam works, in general, is that people are greedy and get blinded by this greed. Conmen have relied on this for ages.

If a bank doesn't notify you that a check is bad within 11 days of the deposit being made, the money is yours legally. (10 days to hear from clearing and 24 hours to notify you after they get it from clearing)

Look into Patrick Combs' story. 

Edit: Lots of people talking out of their ass here.

Patrick Comb's entire story can't be found easily, so here is a link:

http://www.valvetime.net/threads/great-story-about-a-guy-who-gets-100-000-from-a-junk-check-read.118056/

The rule in question is called the ""midnight deadline.""

You can read the whole story there, but part 6 is the one to pay attention to. In it, he contacts the guy who literally wrote the book on the legalities around checks, and the guy told him that he had a legitimate claim to the money. 

You can also read about it here:

http://www.ckfraud.org/UCC_provisions.html
&gt;Section 4-302: A payor bank must pay or return an item or send notice of dishonor by its midnight deadline (midnight on its next banking day following the banking day on which it receives the relevant item or notice). Most bankers are familiar with this requirement, but some do not realize that this strict deadline applies even when the check presented for payment is a counterfeit, or is drawn on a closed account. If an item is presented to you for payment, act expeditiously if you intend to return in unpaid. Otherwise, you may lose the legal right to return the item.

If the bank doesn't notify you within the deadline that they are going to dishonor the check, the money is yours. 

Edit2: I source my claims, including pointing to the exact law, and people still downvote? Really? Brilliant reddit, you are being contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. 

Edit3: I'll also add that I'm not saying the bank will just let you walk with the money. They would undoubtedly close your account and probably sue you and force you to make your case in court... but you would prevail based on the law assuming you didn't know it was invalid or counterfeit when you made the deposit.

"Ok. A few things.

You have an income of $3829, but expenses totaling $3500. You're not accounting for $329 every month. That's nowhere near as bad as some people who've posted expenses on this sub, but you still need to figure out where it's going.

&gt; Rent: $1575 (1 BR, about 300 sq feet)  
&gt; Parking: $150  
&gt; we live downtown and I can walk to work

I want to say something about your high rent, but the reality is you're saving a lot on your commute in gas and wear and tear on a vehicle. On the other hand, this is 44% of your income. (I'm assuming the parking is for your apartment, correct me if I'm wrong).

&gt; Groceries: $524  
&gt; Dining out: $160

This is a lot for only two people. Do you buy a lot of premade food and snacks? How often do you cook your own meals?

&gt; Cell phones: $139

This is a big one. Who is your carrier, how much time do you have left on your contract, and how much would your cancellation fee be? 

Check out [Republic Wireless](https://republicwireless.com/plans/). You'll need to pay your cancellation fee and buy your new phones up front, but you'll definitely save money in the long term. For reference, you pay $110/month more than my wife and I pay for two lines.

&gt; Gas: $100

Not to pry into your personal life, but That's more than I spend on gas (for one car, although I do spend more than that on both), and I *do* have a commute. I know it's an estimate, but where are you going outside of work that you need to spend that much, or do you just have a very low MPG car? Or do you have two cars?

&gt; Monthly transfer to savings: $250  
&gt; Discretionary/entertainment: $300

These should be put together, at least mentally. You're expecting a job loss, so you should cut back your entertainment. Not cut it out completely, you don't want to go crazy. Drop it down to $100.

So, between the $329 you're not accounting for, the $200 from your entertainment, and the $250 you're already saving, you *could* be saving $779/month. The real question is: why aren't you?

You could *easily* cut enough out of your cell phone bill and groceries/dining out to save $1000/month.

&gt; I could potentially be unemployed in the next year

You need to work on that *now*. Along with getting disability for your wife, you *need* to build up an emergency fund. You need to act like you *know* a job loss is coming. 

&gt; There's a bit left over in the budget above. 

That's the $329 I'm talking about. 

&gt; Sometimes that money is real

That money is always real.

&gt; but more often that tends to disappear into discretionary spending.

No, it doesn't disappear. You just don't keep track of it. The very first thing you need to do next paycheck is transfer money into savings. Pay yourself first.",null,null,null,nowhereian,United States,null,1446658704,t5_2qstm,t3_3rhrgx,t1_cwoba92,31,1449595766,0,0,cwockqk,personalfinance,31,null,

"You are in pretty bad funds.

The [Franklin DYNATECH Fund Class ](https://www.franklintempleton.com/retail/app/product/views/fund_page.jsf?fundNumber=108&amp;view=pricing) not only has an expense ratio of .89%, but it also has a front load fee of 5.75%.

A front load fee is where you get charged for the privilege of buying shares in a fund. Say you have $100 to put in that fund. $5.75 gets taken as a sales charge and then you only actually invest $94.25. That is a pretty steep drop in value just for getting started. And  am guessing the other funds you are invested in are like that too. There is absolutely no need to invest in funds that have loads.

The expense ratios are costs that you will always be charged for the duration that you hold onto those funds. To see what an impact high expense ratios have on your portfolio, play with [this helpful tool](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost).

What is also concerning is that you don't mention the investment account type. At $216/month for retirement savings, that is $2,592/year. That should be going into an IRA (whether Roth or traditional will depend on your situation) for the tax advantages since you only get $5,500 of IRA space per person per year. Is that what your advisor is putting you into? Since you don't mention it, I assume not, which does not sound like it is in your best interest at all.

&gt;  for every 54$ I get deducted from my checking, only 34-38$ is actually invested

How is this listed out? Like where are you seeing $54 get pulled in and then only $34 invested?

With a 5.75% sales charge, for every $54 gone from your checking account, only $50.90 would be invested. Which would still be bad, but not as bad as you are seeing. However, without more information we can't figure out exactly what is going on.

&gt; What questions should I ask him during our call (and should I have asked him two years ago)?

I honestly see no reason to have this guy manage your money at all. All you need is an IRA at a low cost, no load brokerage like Vanguard or Schwab and then only [3 Funds](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) to make a fully diversified and balanced portfolio. Or you can get an all-in-one fund that rebalances for you while maintaining an age-appropriate asset allocation by investing in something like a [Vanguard Target Retirement Date Fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/).

Honestly, you can ask why he moved you into these funds and he will probably throw out a lot of buzzwords at you explaining how these are amazing funds to get aggressive growth or steady dividends. But I doubt you will get any sort of satisfactory answer. The reason for that is because you were put into funds that give him commission. By putting you in those funds, he puts a roof over his head, food on the table, and a lake house on his balance sheet.

You can try to ask him if he has a fiduciary duty to you. That means he must put your own financial interests above any financial interests of his own. But he won't agree to that or sign anything to that effect because that is not how he earns his money.",null,null,null,ElementPlanet,null,null,1446515425,t5_2qstm,t3_3rabwk,t3_3rabwk,60,1449561330,0,0,cwmcrhc,personalfinance,60,null,null

"First off. Others have pointed out that you made several mistakes in this situation. Don't make those mistakes again.

As far as your credit union goes, I can see only one thing you can try. I say try because it's not guaranteed to work. I would go in person to the credit union and ask to speak with the manager. Tell the manager how you got fake bills from them and they called you back saying they couldn't help you. Say this: ""Even though you say it can't be proven that I got the fake bills from here, I know that this is where they came from. Since you aren't going to own up to the $150, I'm willing to bet you have more fake bills where that came from and I will be filing a complaint with the FDIC."" (this is for USA. If you're from Canada use equivalent govt agency)

It's likely that the manager will weigh the options: either pay this guy his $150 or potentially have to deal with feds coming in and rifling through every stack of bills that they have.

The manager might tell you to go kick rocks or he might give you $150. It's worth a shot.

**Edit**: Others have pointed out that it is the NCUA that regulates credit unions. ""I will file a complaint with (*insert proper regulatory agency here*)"".

"I've been homeless. Most people who go that route don't come back, and if they do then they're probably irreparably changed/scarred. 

I have no criminal history, am college educated, and it happened so quick that my head spun. I live in constant fear or it happening again, all of my relationships have been destroyed by it (because how the fuck could you, a friend/family member, allow it to happen?) -- I had started a business that was very successful for two years but which was ultimately shut down because of circumstances beyond my control. Depleted my savings before finding a high paying contract gig, which was abruptly terminated 6 months short because the project I was hired to support was canceled. 

For added background I went from homeless to a six figure income in about a year. Maybe I'm the elite 1% of the formerly homeless population and I can tell you that it really lights a fire under your ass, but I've also realized that I was just as hard working/ambitious before it happened as I am now... with just a lot more fear, paranoia, and stress to perform/succeed. 

Now having said that: I have refused to help out my own brother and he's experienced homelessness as well (this was before my stint, so talk about karma.) He is a recovering heroin addict and I felt it was what he needed... basically I thought he was either going to die a junkie on the streets or get his life back together. He got his life back together, but that was the risk I knew I was taking when I refused to help him. The fact he had swindled about a 250K of our inheritance (parents were stupid with how they set the account up) and shot it up his arm contributed greatly. Anyway, we don't have a relationship any longer because he's angry at me for letting him live on the streets, and I'm angry at him for blowing our trust fund (which obviously contributed to me being homeless as well.)

In a situation like that I would never sell my car. At the very least it is a place to sleep and a mode of transportation. 

Strange thing about my brother (no history of assault) is that he seems to be able to find jobs in machine shops all the time, welding, etc., despite a long criminal history. For me it was much much harder and I essentially had to lie my ass off on my resume to get a very in demand job that I had limited experience doing. Fortunately I turned out to be very well suited and good at it, and the rest is history... sort of. Still living like a hermit and paying off debt/student loans. Credit was ruined in the process obviously. 

Basically OP you need to decide whether you want to have a brother or not. I'm 33 and effectively have no family or friends. Being in this situation when I was younger was unfathomable to me, but I assure you it can happen to anyone -- deadbeat, drug addict, or not.

One last thing. When I was homeless I turned to petty theft to eat. I was never caught but had I been caught it probably would have ruined my life totally and precluded any chance of getting the job I finally landed. I had never stolen anything in my life before that but desperate times call for desperate measures, and it sounds like your brother is far more accustomed to stepping outside of the law. 

If you decide to help him then don't half ass it. Consider it signing up for a full rehabilitation. He may need to go to school for a time (you pay), live with you for awhile (you pay), etc, etc, etc. -- You cannot make him feel like a piece of shit during this time or he will resent and hate you for it. You aren't going to do it to be paid back. You're doing it as a gift, and you will have to be patient and expect setbacks. Lay some ground rules and make sure he understands how far you're willing to go to make sure he is OK. That will go a long way.

If you don't want to go down that path then consider yourself to be an only child. Because sooner or later that is going to be the only outcome. The only question is how much emotional baggage you pick up along the way. Bear in mind that as you get older your decision may come to weigh on you and create more baggage/hardship than it would have been to help him.

&gt;They would continue to pay the taxes and take care of any other financial responsibilities for the home.

Maybe.  First, we're assuming the home is completely paid off.  If they transfer the title to you while there is a mortgage, it's due the instant you record that mortgage. Second, if everything works out and the home is transferred to you, the deed is recorded, and 30 years down the road your parents die, you will be slammed with taxes on *100%* of the difference between the home's current value and it's value 30 years from now.

You dont need any of those. The past performance does not mean jack.    
What you should be concerned about:    
The 1,5% buy in fee    
The expense ratios of the funds    

Unless the expense ratio is below 0,5% I would chose none of them. If you want to invest you can open a brokerage account (maybe your bank offers this, but check for fees) and buy low cost index funds instead of this. Ishares ore series, Vanguard, DB X-trackers are your go-to picks.        

For example, the IWDA (or EUNL) ticker symbol is iShares MSCI World index fund. With this you are invested in 85% of the developed world. If you need bonds, to be more safe, then you can check out their low cost bond funds.

I felt professors were better at my CC - classes were also smaller (mostly 20-30). Having tenured professors mostly there for research at a 4-year - they tend to send their TAs to teach canned material. I don't feel like it was as engaging.

From a social perspective:

While you may miss out on some possible social connections being the outsider transferring in, there are a TON of other transfer students AND friendly students both your age and slightly younger.

"Law grad here.  If you aren't 100% convinced that you want to be a lawyer, DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL.  If you're not going to get into a top program and graduate AT LEAST in the top 50% of your class, DO NO GO TO LAW SCHOOL.  If you're not willing to take literally ANY legal job ever following bar passage DO NOT GO TO LAW SCHOOL unless you get a full scholarship.  Do not go to law school at sticker price UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES unless you're willing to risk crushing debt and unemployment or severe underemployment.

I'm not sure about the career path into federal law enforcement out of law school, but I can tell you the job market for new lawyers is still shit (although it's improving a bit, at least down here in Texas).  If you graduate from a top 20 institution in the top 10% of your class, you're likely to have a nice Big Law job waiting for you on the other side, although that guarantee has diminished somewhat in recent years.  Otherwise, you'll be taking what you can get to pay your student loans.

For reference, I graduated from Saint Louis University School of Law in 2013.  I passed the Texas bar on my first try in November 2013.  I worked at a shit personal injury firm for 1.5 years hating my life and making at most $50k/year with a dodgy monthly bonus ($500-$2000 or, often, nothing).  I was EXTREMELY LUCKY in that my dad was a claims consultant (read: he bossed retained counsel around) for State Farm and he knew a number of State Farm retained counsel here in Texas so I was able to obtain my current position where I make $65k/year doing something I love with a wonderful small firm.  Without him, I'd probably still be at the aforementioned shit PI firm.  There are people I graduated with still doing non-legal work.  I have $90k in student loans on IBR which allows this salary to be enough for me and I have opportunities for advancement that make me believe I'll actually one day pay off these loans, but law school was still an awful financial decision overall and I had a 50% tuition paid scholarship.

To contrast, my SO is getting ready to start police academy soon.  His starting salary here in San Antonio will be HIGHER than my starting salary at my first firm.  He has not school debt as he only went to college for a few semesters at technical school.  SAPD has a pension plan, provides regular raises on a yearly basis as long as you remain a cop, tops out at ~$75k/year + bonuses for education and shift work.

"Or random things happen that aren't the car's fault.

I sold a car on Craigslist a few years ago. I lived in a huge apartment complex, so I simply met the guy down in the apartment's parking lot so he didn't see exactly where I lived. Everything went well, cash sale, car was in a great shape.

About 5 weeks went by and I got a call from him. I didn't answer it. No message. A day later I get a call from a random number, my girlfriend unfortunately picked it up and gave the phone to me. It was him.

Turns out the car was stolen from his warehouse. His warehouse's insurance would cover it, only if it was less than 14 days from the date of sale so he was hoping that I hadn't yet filed the paperwork. Too bad I had already filed the paperwork with the DMV the same day I sold it to him.

He was out his $5500, and was pissed saying it was ""normal"" to wait the full 4 weeks before submitting the paperwork (in my state you have 1 month to file it from the day of sale). I saw his son hanging around my apartment's parking lot a few times. Made me a bit nervous, but nothing ever happened.

So lessons learned. Use a Google Voice phone number, and don't meet at a location you regularly visit. Also make sure you file the bill of sale with the DMV immediately just to avoid any further entanglements.",null,null,null,whatthebbq,null,null,1448335876,t5_2qstm,t3_3tzpix,t1_cxav3g8,39,1449986647,0,0,cxazpzf,personalfinance,39,null,null

"This is actually an incredibly common scenario in smaller businesses where the owner/CEO has zero accounting knowledge.

Running a payroll svc such as ADP, Paychex, Gusto, or Trinet requires a base-level knowledge of accounting and payroll.

So when nobody internal has that, you wind up hiring a CPA to perform the withholding calculations for you, and then you remit your checks/direct deposits to employees net, and remit the resulting withholding forms directly to the government agencies responsible for their collection, with payment. In a perfect world a CPA would use a payroll service like one above, but many times smaller (cheaper) CPA firms do it themselves to maximize their margin on the service. This is what results in errors.

It's an incredibly roundabout process, and since there are so many disconnects that require human action (W4 &gt; CPA &gt; CPA's system &gt; withholding calc &gt; form preparation) before you get the ""withholding"" number, there's plenty of room for information to get dropped (usually in those first three steps).

Some information (off the top of my head, so follow up with research before acting):    
1. Your employer and you are BOTH responsible for FICA (social security and medicare taxes). Your employer may be on the hook for these.    
2. You are responsible for Federal Income Taxes. Yes, your employer can get in trouble, and really ought to make things right by either paying outright or assisting you in paying these taxes, but they are under no obligation to do so.     
3. Your state may have stringent laws regarding this, which (if you're not particularly fond of your job) might be of use in getting your employer to help pay your state income taxes, if not more.

Total: $202,547.11

of which Federal:  $22,798.30 

of which Private: $179,748.81

and roughly $100,000 worth of loans with &gt;= 9% interest.

You can use the http://unbury.us calculator to decide which loans to tackle first. You want to get rid of your 9-10% interest rate loans first. 

Check if your federal loans on PAYE/IBR will relieve some pressure. Unfortunately, because your federal loans are so small, their payments may be very close to 10% of your income, which makes the benefit negligible. However, interest subsidy on the federal loans with PAYE may still tilt this in your favor.

Shop around for private student loan consolidation - you may be able to cut the interest rates. Your private loans are likely going to stick around for life. You can call them in times of need for forbearance or similar, but frankly they are damn near impossible to get rid of. Work on raising your income.

"This point is **EXTREMELY** important.  I live in Texas, and depending on where you work, this is going to be a deciding factor on where you buy (well, at least for most people).

When I was renting, there was no way I could even afford to live in some parts of down, forget about buying.  I bought during the last window in my neighborhood in Houston, which now goes for 250K-300K just for lot value only.  

Furthermore, Texas is a state with relatively high property taxes due to no income state tax, so you need to consider that.

House stuff aside, you really need to sit down with your fiance.  If he is tuning you out (his way or the highway), you need to resolve that before you consider moving out of state and purchasing a property with him.

EDIT: I realized that I didn't specify this when I should've, but in Texas, most people drive, and a lot of the ""good schools"" are away from the city center (I don't think all public schools inside the loop are terrible, but that's another issue).

"Keep setting goals for yourself.  You have a ways to go before buying a house, but there is nothing wrong with having long term and short term goals.  These are essentially the baby steps, as popularized by Dave Ramsey.  I am not the biggest fan of his investment advice, but I find his budgeting and debt advice to be fantastic.  Make and follow a zero-sum budget in order to get the most control over your money and your spending.  
 
1.  Pay off Credit Cards.  Almost all money should be going towards your debt.  I, personally, would suspend retirement contributions (except enough to get any company match) until later on.

2.  Save up 6 months income in an emergency fund.  You need to be able to cover emergency vehicle repairs, loss of job, etc without getting back into debt. 

3.  Start saving up for a 20% down payment on a home.  You could resume some or all retirement contributions here.  It just depends on your own priorities/needs.

4.  Retirement contributions should definitely be going again here, and you should be working to maximize as much tax advantaged space as possible.  401k up to company match-&gt;Max IRA-&gt;Max 401k-&gt;Taxable brokerage account.

I'm not going to give you a hard time for looking ahead at buying a home.  But understand that you may catch some flak given that a home is truly a ways off with your current income, debt, and lack of financial safety net.  As long as you know that this is a long term goal type of discussion, then that is fine.  

Apartment/house rental prices can be found inexpensively, even in Atlanta.  What you meant to say was that the rental market is over priced where you want to live.  You can always move.  In fact, you should if you are paying too much in rent.  Do not get in the habit of making excuses.  Start looking for solutions, even if they are hard ones like moving or selling things.

Most bank loans are not using existing money. It isn't money that they could have used elsewhere but that they loaned to you instead. Banks generally simply create it from nothing. In simplest terms they just change the number in your account on a computer, and voila, you have your money. Simultaneously, there is a debt created in the bank's ""account"".

As you pay back your principle, the positive money you give them eliminates the negative money (debt). When all paid off, that loan money has completely disappeared back from where it came from.

The interest doesn't, however. That is existing money that you got from somewhere else and gave to the bank. Where did it come from? Well, that's another topic, but ultimately it comes from increased output of labour per unit input effort (e.g., hours).

Bank loans are not new wealth, but they are created and disappear. They aren't redirected money that could have gone elsewhere. The caveat on this is that banks can't just create an infinite amount of loans this way. They need to have real, existing assets equal to a certain percentage of loans they give out. So in that sense, when they give you a loan there *may* be an opportunity cost based on what reserves they have available to back their loans.

Really, interest is simply an incentive for giving you a loan. If they don't gain anything by giving you a loan, why spend all of the time and effort on the infrastructure, salaries, or starting a bank in the first place? Or take on the risk. If you go bankrupt while owing a loan then you can't pay it back. The bank can only eliminate that negative money on their account using existing money, meaning they take a loss. They can't just delete the -$10,000 and say you don't owe it anymore without using $10,000 from somewhere else -- their own assets. The incentive to take this risk then is that they'll get some of that existing money as profit.

"You will save money by paying it off. Mortgage interest is a *deduction*, not a credit. Don't pay $100 in interest to save $25 off your tax bill.

I agree with some of the others that a new account in just her name be opened. It can be at the same bank; legally, they cannot divulge information about an account to anyone who isn't on the account. 

IMO:
Go back to the original statement, and check any deposits of the old account, and then calculate how much money the mom deposited, to keep everything civil. Leave in the monetary amount the mother contributed, even if she has withdrawn ten times that amount. Withdraw the rest and place it in the new account.  

Also, see if the daughter's name can be removed from the old account. That would ensure the mother would be solely responsible for the account, and it would be up to her what to do about withdrawing the last of the money.  Consider this a life lesson, and write off the ""donation"" to the mother as payment for having financial instruction until the daughter was old enough to go it alone. 

Last bit of advice: go to the Post Office, and rent a PO Box. (Don't bite the lure of a commercial mailing center. That's a whole other can of worms.)  Yes, it's kind of pricey, but totally worth it to have mail be private. Have bills and personal statements sent to the PO Box, and the mother can't ""accidentally"" open the mail and see the statements and account information. 

I don't know if your girlfriend still lives with her parents. If she does, she will want to keep things as civil as possible. Don't hide or lie about the fact a separate account has been opened. Arguments may be inevitable, but try to get her to put it in a positive spin. (""Mom, you have helped me learn so much, and I really, *really* appreciate your teaching me how to manage a bank account. I have decided to try to handle my finances on my own, without your donating to the account, so we can both see whether I've learned what you've tried to teach me."") Or something like that.  A serious meltdown argument might end up with the daughter kicked out of the house before she's set up her own place. Never a good thing.

"Nope, the employer is right. 

That said, the value of the Amazon.com gift cards are likely being taxed as a bonus, and withheld at 25% (this is just how bonuses are generally withheld). Assuming that you/your co-workers are in a lower than 25% tax bracket, this means that the bonus is being over-withheld, and you/your co-workers will received that money back in the form of a tax refund (or reduction of tax bill due to under-withholding on other income). 

Now, I do understand your frustration - if the bonus was in the form of cash, you would still see a net increase in your paychecks because normal paycheck + bonus cash - withholding on bonus would still be higher than what you were receiving before. 

Personally, I would suggest just making the best out of the Amazon.com gift cards.

"This is a bit off topic, but let's explore it. I like where your head is at.

Let's say the 25 year old contributes $18k per year to his 401(k). That's the max he can contribute personally.

(He probably has a company match for 4 or 5%, but let's disregard it for the moment. Honestly, most 25 year olds can't carve out the $18k, and this is just a thought experiment.)

(Let's also disregard the ""catch-up"" contribution after age 50. Is it a good idea to wait until you're 50 to really start saving your dollars for retirement?)

And this 25 year old says, ""I'm good, no reason to save anywhere else. I've got my 401(k.)""

* Present value = 0
* Number of years = 40
* Interest rate = 7%, if he starts retirement NOT in a 2009-style year.
* Payment = $18k
* Future value = $3,593,432

(Not $5 million.)

So much can he pull out of that without affecting principle? Well, it's a point of contention. But most professionals would say between 3 and 5%. If he pulls more than that, he has longevity risk and might outlive his income. (There are other ways to mitigate that risk, but this experiment doesn't include those.)

5% of his principle is $179,671 per year for retirement.

Pretty sweet, right? You can have a good life on $180k per year.

EXCEPT -- 40 years from now, that's shit money. That won't even let him take a vacation to Florida at his same standard of living. Why? INFLATION.

Here's the calculation:

* Present value = $100,000 (his present salary, hypothetically)
* Number of years = 40
* Interest rate = 3% (historically 3.25%, but 2.4% recently.)
* Payment = $0
* Future value = $326,000

**Yes, he needs $326,000 in retirement just to maintain his standard of living when he was 25 years old.**

So, his 401(k) didn't cut it. He has to retire on half the standard of living he had when he was working.

Weird, right?

(Oh, and ALL OF THAT MONEY IS TAXABLE. Your 401(k) has something called ""tax risk,"" in that it might not be the same tax rates in 40 years that it is now.)

"&gt;I'm posting as a throwaway so my fiance doesn't see this. 

This is a problem, a relationship problem. You need to fix this before you do anything else.

&gt;He has no idea what the details are and insists that's all we need to save for retirement, saving more on top of that would be ludicris.  It's the only financial thing I have no clue what's going on, all others are combined already.

See sbove.

&gt;As for debt, he has $2,000 left he refuses to just pay off and keeps paying the minimum payment on, so that he can put more cash into the home fund.  We have $3,000 left on a vehicle.  That's all our debt.

That may not be bad if it's a low interest debt, and the loan is almost over.

&gt;We plan to move to Texas (from California) when we hit $60,000, where a home he wants is about $300,000.  Then we would have a 20% down payment.  But that would wipe us out in terms of our savings, and that's another 6 months with nothing going into retirement.

See my first response.

&gt;Here is the bottom line: we are not highly educated.  Though I have read through all of the topics on the sidebar, and read this sub every day for about 3 years,  I don't understand much of what I read.  I'm trying, I really am.  I signed up for a beginning investment Coursera class and the first two were so far beyond my understanding of compounding interest and I had a small breakdown.  My fiance works 6 days a week, usually 12 hour shifts, so while this is not an excuse, he is tired and we're not in the position to attend a physical financial class. 

You need to make this a priority.

&gt;What I'm looking for is an online course solely in the basics corner stones of financial readiness.  Someone who writes out how much we should be putting towards savings, towards retirement, and towards home buying at this point in our life, and THEN EXPLAINS WHY!  WHY IS IMPORTANT.  Preferably with visuals, like showing how this money grows etc.

You're really not going to find this as everyone's situation is going to be different. You'll find very general advice, but nothing tailored to you.

&gt;I have found lists online that I show the fiance, that say things like, first pay off debt, then put 10% into an IRA, then have $10,000 in emergency savings, THEN save for a house, but they don't have an explanation in a way he can understand so he writes them off.  He wants a house and yard in a safe place for his kid, and I'm afraid he's going to put us in a bad place financially to do so (we don't live in a safe area, that's why we can save so much for the house, our rent is dirt cheap).   I need someone to explain it fully, hopefully visually, because we are good at watching a youtube video with graphs or charts and understanding better then.  Does anyone know where I can find this?  Or is there a physical class other than the Dave Ramsey class (he won't go to those because of some horrible things that happened to him in the church when he was a teen)?

I wouldn't recommend Dave Ramsey for anything but paying off debts.

It sounds like you need to sit down with your fiance and have a talk about doing this together. Him refusing to hear you is a problem.  One of the top reasons for divorce are money related.

"I think the main issue is to identify how you got here in the first place, and fix those bad habits. 2nd importance is how you fix your current debts.

1) I personally would never live on a budget where my known expenses are within $200 of my income and think its ok. That is not enough to build an Emergency Fund and to pay for unexpected expenses. Every month transfer a portion of your paycheck into an account you won't touch. ""Pay yourself first""

2) You need to keep track of your finances. Not knowing where your account balance went is scary. Use mint.com or ynab.com to do this.

"I've heard they can be safe investments. And when you think about it they are a lot more solid investment than say a hedge fund. It takes the guessing out of stocks/bonds and such and replaces it with equity, which will always have a high value. You should research the area, if it's nice and getting nicer - definitely take it as an investment. We'll get another president and after that you should be in a position to decide if the property increased wealth or if it just broke even. In the worst scenario you lose money in it through some unseen thing, like damage by a storm or something, space debris. So you keep it in the family, which is incredible in itself, to have the memory alive and right before your eyes like her estate. I dont think other siblings would be jealous, they probably dont have the money and if they did they might have other plans for it. You should definitely buy the property from your gma's. It lets you keep an eye on your gma, through cameras or paying an in-house caretaker, which is something old people would LOVE over having to move out of there own home. I only know this as my great-gma died oct 8th. I have a grandfather who  has a reverse mortgage and my uncle already called it. It's a situation where if you can get it paid for, it's always a good idea. It reduces the hassle your elder goes through and you can visit. That's huge. Old people in retirement homes are so sad.  My grandma was like that an no one was with her when she passed, and I feel like that's not at all how her life has impressioned me to be. edit: I also have this to add. My father's friend mother died while in a reverse mortgage and no one bought the house even capable of paying it off. I think this was due to the fact that my fathers friend has been mooching but I'm not sure. I hear that his brother tried to keep the house but the mooch kept blocking him out of it, so there may definitely be a rivalry among siblings for it.

"I am in the US, so if you are not, this may not apply to you. 

This is a hard question to answer without knowing you insurance particulars. Do you have insurance? Was the helicopter ride deemed not necessary? Was a doctor out of network. Etc. If you have insurance, call them. They may try to deny the claim based on one of those reasons. They did that for me, saying the emergency was not really an emergency. In my case, I went to an appointment with my primary care doc and got dizzy. She was worried about a blood clot so sent me to the hospital via ambulance. Insurance refused to cover it because it was seen as not an emergency. So here is what my attorney friend told me to do, and it worked. You mileage may vary, however. 

Call up your insurance and talk to them about the ""Prudent Layperson Standard."" This, essentially, states that because you are not a medical professional, you are inclined to listen to the advice of medical professionals. So, if they said ""put him on a helicopter"" then they put you on a helicopter. Because you are a layperson in the matter, you have no reason to contest their advice. Therefore, it was deemed an emergency because you were told so by medical professionals. Thus, insurance is obligated to pay.

"I think there is some confusion regarding what ""taxable"" means. Just to be clear that withdrawals for ""[qualified education expenses](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch08.html#en_US_2014_publink1000178531)"" from 529 plans are not taxable at the state or federal level.

This can be confused with the **deductability** of 529 contributions. Different states have different rules and some states will only allow a deduction if you make a contribution to that state's plan (Oregon for example) while other states will allow you to deduct a contribution to any state plan (Pennsylvania for example). 

Also note if you don't use the money for qualifeid education expenses you will be taxed on all of the gains as ordinary income and pay a 10% penalty (there are a few [exceptions](http://www.savingforcollege.com/intro_to_529s/what-is-the-penalty-on-an-unused-529-plan.php) though)",null,null,null,psychojunglecat,null,null,1448302247,t5_2qstm,t3_3twb1l,t1_cxa7wx6,24,1449975866,0,0,cxad4ud,personalfinance,24,null,null

"&gt; The wires are always sent to fake names and collected by people with fake ID. There's never surveillance video shown of the person who collected the monies.

Not necessarily. What's becoming more common is that the wires are sent to other regular people, who are actually victims of different scams. A hypothetical example using OP's grandma:

1. Grandma gets letter saying she's won the lottery and is convinced to wire $100k of her own money. The money is wired to Persons A, B, and C, let's say $33k each. 
2. Person A receives the money. She is involved in a different scam, and thinks she is receiving this money from her online boyfriend. She forwards most of the funds to Person D for whatever reason her ""boyfriend"" has given her.
3. Person B receives the money. He has just gotten a new job online as a ""personal assistant"" and has been told he needs to receive and send wires as part of his job. He wires out the money to Person E, his ""boss"" or ""coworker.""
4. Person C receives the money. He thinks he is getting an inheritance from his long-lost relative in Egypt. Then he wires most of the money out to Person F, a ""customs agent"" who will help him get his inheritance into the U.S.
5. D, E, and F receive the money. They are probably victims too. The cycle continues. 

Eventually the money makes its way into the hands of the scammers, usually in a trickle along the way. ($1000 here, $500 here, $2500 here, etc.) Usually by Western Union or prepaid cards. The people who pick up the money on the other end are never the head honcho, either. 

It gets super, super complicated. It's sadly not a cut and dry issue of ""oh, trace the wire and find out who it went to, and ta da! You've caught the criminal."" The scammers have gotten too smart for that. :(

As for Western Union and other similar businesses, I am not familiar with their policies, although I know they're very heavily regulated. When you think about it, though, it's not really fair for them to be responsible as long as they follow their due diligence. They're just a transfer service and can't generally be responsible for who their customers decide they want to send money to. I have talked to WU agents before who say they stop a lot of people at the gate when they hear a suspicious story (such as ""oh, this is for my Nigerian online boyfriend"" or ""someone overpaid me for my Craigslist sale and I'm sending them back the rest"").",null,null,null,happypolychaetes,null,null,1447825330,t5_2qstm,t3_3t8nov,t1_cx48hl3,101,1449870238,0,0,cx48rt9,personalfinance,101,null,null

"&gt; Why then, have I heard from so many people that they'd rather remain on unemployment than get a less than ideal job?

If I can wait an extra week for a job that pays better, have better benefits, and gives me more enjoyment, then of course I will be on unemployment an extra week to make sure I get that job.

&gt; True Example: A former friend of mine had a high paying job as a programmer. He got laid off and was on unemployment for a loooooong time. When I asked him why he didn't get a job as a waiter or something, he bragged about getting the maximum unemployment amount and claimed that it was more money than working some menial job. Was he right? Am I not seeing some extra unemployment money somewhere?

As a programmer, I have to study really hard for the interviews. They ask questions that involve things I would normally just Google in a real job, so I need to spend time memorizing. I also need time to get a portfolio site together to show interviewers. This stuff takes time. I'd rather focus on getting another job soon rather than do menial jobs for a couple of dollars. A lot of menial jobs also makes it hard to schedule a time for interview. On top of that, are you going to be able to get a job working at McDonalds when you are normally a programmer?

Also, a tip for being unemployed in California. Make sure you apply for at least one job a week to get the unemployment. I spent one week constantly in interviews and talking with recruiters and didn't apply for another one just so I can let the number of interviews settle.

"I've always wondered *why* that is. The whole ""elderly people being overly trusting"" thing. Shouldn't being older actually make you crafty and cynical? We've all heard the phrase ""I wasn't born yesterday,"" right? The implication being that we become harder to fool as we gain life experience.

And in this sort of case, it's not even a case of being confused by technology. Wire transfers and wire fraud have both been around since these people were young, so I can't see how it's a matter of understanding modern systems.

Well, he didn't want to outright tell this lady ""you've been had"", and she told us she'd just sent off a small checks to them as they instructed.  So he kind of hinted around ""this might be a scam"" and said we'd look into it for her and get back to her, then booked an appointment for a week later.  I took ten minutes or so to find some online news and government articles, including some that specifically mentioned the company scamming her, printed them out, and the next week he sat this poor lady down and said ""you're not going to be a millionaire.""  It was at that point the lady pulled out her checkbook and showed him a *lot* of cheques written over the past several years to similar scams.

"To add to this: once your money crosses a national border it is never coming back. The bank in the 2nd country will only act based on orders from that country's police/courts/regulators. Since the crime happened in the 1st country there is actually no crime in the 2nd country to investigate. 

Instead, you will need to get the police/courts/regulators in the 1st country to open a case in their own country, then have them contact their counterparts in the 2nd country, and then the counterparts in the 2nd country may open a local case and if do they may then ask their local bank to freeze the account. This will take weeks if not months and by this time the account will be either closed or empty.

Furthermore, oftentimes accounts in the 2nd country are opened using stolen national IDs so the supposed account holders will have no idea there's even such an account in their name.

"Thought a lot about how to explain this to my grandmother. She would bring these things up, and according to her she never sent any money but unfortunately I don't believe her. For scammers it is a numbers game. Send out a thousand letters and all you need is one person to bite. Like most people my grandmothers age she wasn't exactly on top of technology. She had no concept of how easy it is to send 1000 letters or how easy it was for someone to get her name and address. For almost her entire life anything addressed to her came from someone she knew or someone who had a good reason to send something to her because typing a personalized letter took a lot of time. She'd insist that they couldn't be mailing the same thing to thousands of people because they used her name a bunch of times. I'm pretty sure she never understood it even when I tried to explain how easy it would be to ""personalize"" a form letter with a computer. Sometimes she'd get fake stuff purporting to be from real banks and she'd point out how the logo matched exactly and it had the same address and phone number as the real stuff she got. I showed her how I could get that information in seconds on my phone. Again it just never occurred to her that I could download a bank's logo and print it myself on letterhead in 10 seconds.

"1. Rule of thumb is you pay down highest interest debt first, so your student loans.

2. That Cell Phone plan looks expensive, I'd be looking to cut that in half as soon as you can. We don't know much about what the average rental costs are for what would suit your needs, so that would be a start. Generally you need to put a down payment of the first couple weeks of rent and a security deposit for the place. Honestly, it might sound like bad advice but I don't think you're in a position to contribute too much towards your retirement account. I'd really focus on setting yourself up to be independent (i.e food/rent) and building your emergency fund as you're doing. Once you've finished your emergency fund, split it to long term savings and your retirement funds.

3. How long have you been at your degree and what field is it in..? $5k isn't too much in loans, so I'd say if it's going to benefit your career; go for it.

"&gt;Nevermind that the IRS themselves directly contradict the idea that a sole proprietorship is not a business.. 

The entire point is not whether it's a business or not, but whether a large number of people who work as freelancers should be using ally bank.

However, to play along with your argument, I can say that that may not be a legal definition, but rather a paragraph trying to help people fill out tax forms, and that it has no bearing on the other legal implications of a sole-proprietorship.

For example: http://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/sole-proprietorship:

""Definition: A business that legally has no separate existence from its owner. Income and losses are taxed on the individual's personal income tax return.""

""The owner of a sole proprietorship typically signs contracts in his or her own name, because the sole proprietorship has no separate identity under the law.""

"" Sole proprietor owners can, and often do, commingle personal and business property and funds, something that partnerships, LLCs and corporations cannot do. Sole proprietorships often have their bank accounts in the name of the owner.""

""The owner of a sole proprietorship typically signs contracts in his or her own name, because the sole proprietorship has no separate identity under the law. The sole proprietor owner will typically have customers write checks in the owner's name, even if the business uses a fictitious name. Sole proprietor owners can, and often do, commingle personal and business property and funds, something that partnerships, LLCs and corporations cannot do. ""

Simply put, MANY banks allow you to use personal accounts. My complaint is not ""I'm not doing any business"", but rather ""Ally has weird rules for their definition of business, they didn't warn me about them, and many other banks WOULD allow what Ally does not.

Some people work one or two jobs and get paid a 1099 semi-regularly just like a normal job, so I would think they should be fine to use a personal account.

"&gt;Have you read the Other Banks' disclosures? 

Yes, I make a habit of reading 35 pages of fine print for banks I don't have accounts at.

&gt;Here is the one from Chase, the first one I looked for. Says the same thing. ""You agree not to use it for business purposes.""

Again, hidden in only 35 pages of fine print! Amazing they don't make that more clear considering that about 34% of the people in the US are 1099 freelance workers.

&gt;The issue, and why you are being down voted, is you are trying to argue Ally is in the wrong,

Ally is in the wrong for not having clearly defined policies. Can a 1099 freelancer have an account there? How many clients can that freelancer have before getting dropped? And they are in the wrong for having a warning period that is way too short.

&gt; without acknowledging you are not doing the due diligence to run a business. 

Since a lot of people responding to my post are apparently making the same mistake, I think it's clear that the post is warranted. Read the other comments. A few other people are freelancing or selling online with Ally bank. This post helped them. But you would rather downvote it because of your own anger at my attitude of being unhappy with the bank about it? Talk about ego on your part.

&gt;If you walk into a bank today, and tell them you are looking for an account to deposit funds from a sole proprietor business, they will point you to a business checking account.

If I walk into a store and ask for ear plugs, half of them point me to in-ear headphones. That's not a real method for determining things.

&gt; Since you can open an Ally account without talking to a human, the onus is on you to read everything they provide to you. Self service is a two edged sword.

Yes, and since most people like myself don't read 35 pages of fine print, I'm trying to help other people avoid the same problem with a bank that doesn't support what other banks do, and has unclear policies.

&gt;What is really scary, is what other things you should be doing to protect your self and the business, that you are not doing and no one has told you about. Such as getting City and State permits, and filing appropriate forms. Also, what insurance are you getting to protect yourself from possible claims. Impact on your home or car insurance also comes to mind.

We've got city and state permits, though very few are required for a sole-proprietorship. We've paid state and federal taxes, we're even tracking sales tax by individual zip codes. We've done a lot of due diligence and have accountants helping us with it all.

Right now, all she is doing is keeping herself afloat. shes not decreasing her debt, I'm hoping  she just isn't increasing it.

The credit cards have to go.

Also, why on earth did she buy such an expensive car? What was the reasoning for that?

Living way beyond her means with that vehicle. Get rid of that car if you can and get something used and cheaper.

My husband and I recently got rid of a newer car and $250 car payment as we were gifted a 1999 CRV from my mother. We have the CRV, and a 2014 Escape @ $248/month. It makes a huge difference because we carry only liability on the CRV as well. It's allowing us to save for the purchase of a new car when the CRV is no longer running.

All tax return dollars you have need to go to the high interest credit cards. Every single dollar. No ""I'll take $200 for X and put the rest towards my card."" 

Every single tax return dollar goes to your credit cards.

My husband brought about 10k of credit card debt to our marriage and through putting all tax returns, birthday money, wedding money, etc., toward his credit card,  and altering his spending habits, we are down to  $247 on that card. This was accomplished in two years and getting married 2 months ago and putting all of our wedding money towards the credit card helped a lot. We could have gone on a honeymoon, but starting our marriage almost debt free (minus student loans) was a honeymoon in itself.

We have a household income
of $125k+ and my husband still has a second job. maybe she could consider getting a second job until at least the credit cards are paid off? 

This is a spending issue, not an income issue. i know its a spending issue because of the credit card debts.

there needs to be a change in spending habits ASAP. This isn't impossible to overcome, but it's definitely going to require work.",null,null,null,data_girl,null,null,1447621836,t5_2qstm,t3_3sxk3v,t3_3sxk3v,20,1449819226,0,0,cx1alt5,personalfinance,20,null,null

"a collection will drop off your credit between seven and eight years after it first goes delinquent. thus, over time, your credit will improve, assuming you do not continue to do things that screw it up. your dad is correct about this.

however, depending on the state and age of the debt, the collector can sue you for the full balance plus fees and costs, and if they do, that will follow you around forever.

so it's not really possible to give you advice about what you should do, since we don't know how old the debt is and where you are.

also, one last thing: fuck your conscience. this isn't about your conscience, or what's right or wrong. an extension of credit like a credit card is a business decision, and entails a certain amount of risk on the part of the lender. extending credit or not is a decision made that balances risk versus reward (i.e., the chance you won't pay versus the amount of money they'll make in interest and fees over the life of the account). in this case, you didn't pay, which is a risk they knowingly took when they gave you the card.

from your perspective, paying or not paying should also be a business decision, again based on risk versus reward. can you get them to remove the entry from your credit entirely? if so, that weighs in favor of paying. is the debt so old that they can no longer sue you to recover it? that weighs in favor of not paying.

First, make sure you understand how your financial advisor is compensated. If he receives a commission for selling you certain financial products, then you should think of him as a salesperson, not an advisor. In this case you should seek advice from knowledgeable friend/relatives or pay a fee-based financial advisor if such services are available in your country.

Second, consider risk as well as return. You mentioned that mutual funds have a return of 8-10%. Not sure where you got that statistic from, but I think it's an overly broad statement. Every mutual fund has different stocks inside of it, and some will perform better or worse than 8-10%.

Dave Ramsey is a financial advisor who HATES debt.  His mentality is ""you cant be wealthy as long as you have debt"".  So debit cards, but not credit cards.  IE... MONEY in your account, not a line of credit.

Now yes, there are some little hiccups along the way, like getting an apartment in a out of town area.  But you've gotten it.  Establishing a year of on-time payments is all you need.  If you do that, the leasing office wont care about your credit score in a year.

I'm ok with your dad refusing to encourage you to build credit, but he should have prepared you in other ways.  Having a checking account with a years worth of rent payments so ""credit history"" would not have been a concern if you rolled up and showed them that.  Things like that can get around a credit card.

You're doing good if you don't have any debit.  Read Dave Ramsey and maybe you'll go down that road.

Not always true.  I received a promotion last year that had increased responsibilities and no pay raise.

A year later, the two of us who accepted the responsibility received a sizable pay increase and the guy who turned it down received nothing and basically screwed his chances at advancement.

While Government is different than the Private sector, sometimes due to various factors, companies won't give out pay raises at various times of the year.

There are benefits for using life insurance in this way.

You usually think of insurance as a worst-case back up type deal, but what about best case? Your kid gets a scholarship and is only paying $5,000/year for school. Now all that money you put into the 529 plan isn't very helpful, and you'll lose a good piece of it. But the equivalent amount kept in an insurance policy will just make it grow more.

BUT, you have to put a lot into it to make it worth while. I don't know your income, but an insurance plan that will pay out &gt;$200,000 over those 4 years won't come cheap.

"Not worth it in my opinion. Everything is negotiable in life, if they didn't want him they wouldn't have offered him the position.  If they are the prime and he is working for the sub contractor then they were already paying his salary via the sub, *although* I'd bet that they were paying more to the sub as the sub probably had his labor marked up so they get a piece of the pie as well for his efforts.  That is how it works with subs and primes.

He absolutely should ask for more money and not just a small amount, go big, like another $10K or more big.  The sub was probably charging the prime close to $60K for his work and only paying him the $47K and they likely knew that.  So they are trying to get him to do the same work and then some for less than they were paying for him to do it originally when he was still under the sub.   

There is nothing wrong with them trying to do this, it is smart business.  However they are also probably prepared to pay much more considering that they were already shelling out more for his work when he didn't work for them.

"Hi /u/anotherhouse,

I'm writing this as a reply to /u/SpicedApple's post because the content of the post is just so bad I can't avoid doing this. They are encouraging you to act against your own financial interests on some moral point. Do **NOT** let people convince you that your financial interests rest on moral vs. immoral. It is only legal vs. illegal. such as: ""Am I legally able to do XYZ to encourage a better financial position?""

Do you think that /u/SpicedApple sits down before April 15th trying to maximize the amount they pay to the government? Of course not! Everyone from rich to poor does everything they can to maximize their position and minimize their risks. If you don't look our for yourself, nobody else is going to.

&gt; This is *such* a bad idea. I don't know why it's so common. 

It is common because everyone can see how the system works and they respond accordingly. /u/SpicedApple is attempting to put the blame for a broken system onto the people crushed under the system rather than the system itself. That is very, very wrong.

&gt; So they went out and purchased long term care insurance, making the entire fear moot, right?

Purchased from who, with what money, and maintained for how long? When was the last time you shopped the market? Yesterday, a week ago, or a year ago? Never? Well, I've definitely shopped it and unaffordable doesn't remotely describe its relationship to health insurance. Improbable is closer. Impossible is about right. $1200 per month for the next 20 - 30 years and the people I shopped for were only in their late 50s or early 60s.

If you want to point to a solution, make sure it is at least remotely possible to purchase it. Otherwise, you just make it look like you're on a moral crusade clueless about how it really impacts people. I'll bet you would tell someone who doesn't qualify for the medicaid to buy health insurance too. Genius solutions abound.

&gt; Maybe. First, we're assuming the home is completely paid off. 

wat

I think /u/anotherhouse already covered that...

&gt; Parents want to put their **(fully paid)** house in my name

Yep, already covered. For somebody that wants to seem like they have all the answers, that is just sloppy. For anything else here, I would say consult a CPA, lawyer, or Google. Everything here is suspect.

&gt; I think you mean your grandparents participated in a fraud

This is the fun part where they try to equate fraud which is criminal, illegal, and punishable with a moral view that they are trying to force onto you against your own financial best interests. Do not listen to them. There is no fraud when you follow the letter of the law. That is why you use a lawyer to ensure that everything is done to legal standard.

If someone wants to yell fraud while you save your family hundreds of thousands of dollars, let them. It isn't your, or your family's, fault that long term care insurance is unaffordable. It isn't your fault that nursing home care is unaffordable. You didn't design the system you are now suffering from. The only obligations you have in the face of that is to fully follow the law and save as much of your family's money as you can.

&gt; Tell your parents to stop being clowns and buy long term care insurance. If they're scheming years out on how to commit welfare fraud, they've got a problem.

Tell your parents to consult a lawyer about estate planning. They will be able to help with this as it is a very common request/problem. It is not and will never be fraud when you follow the law with the help of a lawyer. /u/SpicedApple will learn that someday.

Good luck OP!

"We have a dog which has a habit of eating things he is not supposed to, requiring multi thousand dollar surgeries.. One trick that we learned from the most recent bout is to go to the vet clinic ( where we pretty much had 1600 left to our name and 2 weeks until any cash came through ) we had asked for quotes up front and were told that the surgery could range from 600 to 3000 depending on the damage internally and they wouldn't know until they started.

Surgery came to 2000, plus medications, and aftercare , and the initial consult, and X-rays/ultrasounds, and repeat appointments, etc.. 
Final cost was just over 4 and a half grand. 

So we simply told them , all we can spend on this dog is 800, and suggest that we can pay them that if they can put the dog down instead of us needing to have follow up visits.. 

It was amazing how fast the cost of the surgery dropped, along with them waiving costs of the initial consults, 500 dollar X-rays dropped to under 50 dollars, follow up visits became a single follow up visit guaranteed to be $50, surgery was dropped to 400, we ended up paying about 850 in the end simply because we bluffed them with, fine.

"Hey man, apologies about the brain-dump to follow, but I'd like to throw some things your way.

First and foremost, I know what it's like to come from a family that's ""not financially well off"" and to be simultaneously fighting with the black dog. So if you stop reading now the one thing I want you to know is that shit can be better than it is now, and there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows out here, but it's better.

**ON HEALTH**

* /u/RexualChocolate is totally right about exercise. Even if you can't get outside right away, exercise inside for a start. It helps. I had to start with DDR, but if that's not your bag, [here's a collection of body-weight routines](http://waffleguppies.tumblr.com/post/127585612932/alexardensutton-borzou-amtrax) to get you started, and a [masterlist of music](http://talythiastarseeker.tumblr.com/post/128043153076/winterazalea-classical-the-old-masters-i) to listen to while you work.

* Your mental health goes hand-in-hand with the physical. Check out /r/mentalhealth and /r/anxiety here on reddit (they're good people), and for more local help [The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health](http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dmh/) and their [resource guides](http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/provider/guidelines-resources/clinical-treatment/mental-health/dmh-resource-guides.html). (Nationally, we also have [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml))


**ON JOBS**

When it comes to jobs, there is no need to throw yourself directly into the deep end. If you are stable (you have a roof over your head and food to eat), make learning new skills and looking for jobs your new job. I *highly* recommend starting with a part-time job, by the way, given your situation. Others here may disagree with me, but I strongly believe a part-time job would be much less stressful and provide a much better transition into the job market than trying to dive right in.

When I say ""part-time"" I don't even necessarily mean a solid 20 hours/week gig. You can start with something small like tutoring with an actual company ([Here's a map of anything relating to ""tutoring"" in your state](https://www.google.com/maps/search/massachusetts+tutoring/@42.4506073,-71.7858553,9z/data=!3m1!4b1)) or independently at high/middle/elementary schools. (You might actually be a natural at English as a Second Language tutoring, because children in that situation *need* someone who understands what it's like to feel isolated and anxious if you excuse my being blunt.)

Not only will a part time job provide you with time to recover from work, but your ""spare time"" can be used to learn new skills online. For example:

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Selected courses: [""Make a Website""](https://www.codecademy.com/skills/make-a-website), [""Learn Ruby on Rails""](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-rails)

* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) - [Library](https://www.khanacademy.org/library)

* If art is more your thing: [DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/?section=&amp;global=1&amp;q=tutorial), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tutorials) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/poppytalk/diy-and-tutorials/) have a lot of tutorials about a lot of things

* /r/resumes can help you make your resume all clean and sparkly, but be prepared for some savage critique. Those guys are vicious, but it's all worth it in the end.

**ON MOTIVATION**

Staying motivated to do things like the above can be difficult, especially when you're not in the right space to keep going yourself, so sometimes you need things besides yourself to help motivate you, so here are some things that helped me, and I hope at least some of them might help you as well.

* Get your own bank account if you don't already. Having more control over your finances, knowing where things are going and watching your money grow and your debt shrink feels really nice. For me it felt like every payment on my debt was a little less weight on my shoulders, and knowing that ""This is my money. Not my family's money, and no one but me decides what to do with it."" is also a really good feeling. 

* Sit down and make a list of things you want. Solid, tangible things. For me, it was things like ""I want to build my own computer"" and ""I want to move to X location."" By having something solid to hold on to, it's easier to understand the literal price of the things you want, and that helps you stay on track towards getting them. They're no longer ""Things I would someday like"" but rather ""Specific things that I want, and I know how long I need to work to get them.""

* Use someone/something else as your calendar. Set specific deadlines to make sure you stick to schedule. (E.g. ""I will make a payment on my debt each month on the same day that X happens."")

* Clean your space. You don't have to go [full-minimalist](https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism), but keeping your area clean and actually [cleaning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1-HMMX_NR8) (the act itself) doesn't just feel nice, it helps you feel more in control. That room? That's YOUR room, you are the master of that space. You choose what stays in it, nothing more, nothing less.

* Avoid robots. You know the kind I mean. 

Now to bring it all back around.

**ON PERSONAL FINANCE**

* $7000 is not an insurmountable amount of debt, especially when you have a place to stay and things to eat. You live with people who love you and care about you, they aren't kicking you out. You're safe.

* You DO have marketable skills. As people who play video games, we are *trained* to have certain skillsets you can use to your advantage. Some examples: Attention to detail (""Is that thing over there just part of the ground, or a mine?""), high concentration/problem solving abilities, digital research (""How the hell do I solve this puzzle? Let's ask the internet.""), and the ability to learn new programs quickly.

"Sure, you can do it.   

Just remember that building a house is a pretty involved project.  You don't say if you plan to do the work yourself, so I presume you'll want to contract it out.  Custom building is going to be a more expensive proposition than an average per-square-foot cost, since the builder won't have any economy of scale working on a one-off project.  You also may decide that since this is ""your"" house, you'll want to go with various upgrades that will be reflected in the cost.  And of course the builder is motivated to bid low to get the business, then increase the charges to improve margins.

Still, it is something that can be done.  I've done it myself, even.

Everything turned out great, actually, with one exception.  I wanted some custom railings on an exposed staircase.  I gave the builder an example of the wrought iron style I wanted, and told him he could find them from his favorite supplier.  As weeks went by, I would ask the status, and it was always something that we would talk about a little bit later...it was always ""too soon"" to discuss that.  

Until one day I stopped by the house and he had put up some god awful wood 2x2 railings on it.  Since it was now ""too late"" to talk about it.  And at that point we were overtime on the schedule and trying to get to occupancy.  He said he would address it post-sale, and gave a credit on the price.  

And those railings are still there.

"The general reason to buy a new house and not an existing house is that you get exactly what you want.  Nothing is absolute.  But, a rule of thumb is that a brand new house will cost you 15% to 30% more than buying an existing build.  It will also require more cash up front, typically ~30% (kinda a down payment) of the project cost.  

Now, there are some exceptions.  If you can be your own contractor, deal with permits, hire subs, etc... yourself, you can save at least 20% since that's about what what the contractor's take is.  If you can do some of the work yourself (electrical, plumbing, framing, etc...) that's further savings.  

But, most of the guys who do that themselves are construction professionals, engineers, and architects who already know the business and have contacts with subs.  A typical weekend DIYer would lose their shirt trying to contract a job them self.  

Another exception is a weird market.  There are some places where it's just easier and cheaper to build than buy.  There aren't many, because contractors and subs will know that and try to increase their fees to compensate.  But, you can negotiate around, at least in theory.

"Thanks for an answer that's actually useful to me. I've thought about purchasing for a long time, and I have worked out my budget fairly well. I can still save enough for emergencies and retirement after considering bills and maintenance. 
Your point about interest only encourages me more. With interest rates so low it makes more sense to me to buy now so that I can start putting money towards the actual house sooner rather than later. Because of this though I only have about 10% down, but I know people buy with much less down than that so I'm not all that concerned. 
I've rented for a long time, and I simply cannot justify throwing more money away when I'm in a good position to buy in a market that is still somewhat affordable and expected to not be within a few years.

2. It's good not to live paycheck to paycheck...  But yeah, I think short term DI is great, but I would rather have the emergency fund...  Just my opinion. ;-)

3. Coordinating with SSID is fine, it's better than not having any disability coverage at all. Most people are woefully underinsured for disability.

The other thing to think about is that group DI does not give you cost of living adjustments. If you have 30 years of work ahead of you, with inflation at 2-4%, you're looking at more than doubling your income over the next 30 years just to keep up with inflation. If you are disabled for 30 years, you'll have to live on ""half"" of what you do now because of the cost of living.

Is the ambulance agency a commercial or volunteer agency? Are you willing to share the name? 

In terms of getting this resolved, most agencies aren't out to bankrupt people. Payment plans are generally accepted or billing reduced. The bill amount you have provided sound extremely high considering the injuries or lack thereof you described. It's possible there was an error. 

As others have suggested, your best bet is to call the agency directly and see what they are willing to do to help. Ask to be given a copy of the chart. They should be able to explain why the cost is so high, and also offer recourse for you.

"The 'full coverage' term just have to die. It doesn't mean anything without additional information for context.

Full coverage does not say what the coverage limits and deductible are, it does not say whether PIP is included and if included who pays first, it might sometimes include collision and comprehensive and sometimes not and more.

My friends often ask me why I pay $180/mo when they only pay $100 for 'full coverage' and think I'm stupid or something. I explain them that I can get the same coverage for $100 as well insuring only for state minimum limits but most often state minimums are not adequate at all when in an accident and hence I normally take higher limits which obviously increases the cost. So, 'full coverage' mean nothing, especially when comparing cost.

To get the best return on the savings you should put it into a stock fund. You might find a good fund that specializes in education but a general stock fund or mixed fund will be good.

"I have some experience with this so please pay attention. 

The university has you on their account as having taken the classes and since you never took any tests, or submitted any homework to the teachers, then you were considered a no-show (basically those people that don't go to class and just spend their college time partying) They probably put you on academic probation and actually believed that you did attend and just don't want to pay. 

I know this sounds terrible, (""Why would they charge him for classes he didn't take?!?"") but the university doesn't expressly know that you just weren't lazy and didn't try. 

I will say that some of the fault should be on the adviser. Although they almost never withdraw you from classes, this person should have been able to point you in the right direction.

Here is where you can try to fix your situation. The majority of major universities have retroactive withdrawal from classes. Usually they have a time frame of 2-3 years from the date of the last class taken. Take note: **You** **need** **to** **find** **out** **what** **that** **process** **is**, **and** **complete** **it** **as** **quickly** **as** **possible.** I'm not exactly sure why the adviser would not have informed you of this, they should have been able to show you how to start the process. Usually, the forms and information are on the Registrar's website. I would check there first.

The next step, after you have retroactively withdrawn, is to apply for a **tuition appeal.** This process can be long and arduous. Generally you need to show some evidence of you not attending, or a medical or family issue that did not allow you to attend. In your case you should be able to show the grades, flight information, and any correspondence with the overseas school to prove you actually did not attend the classes. When you file your tuition appeal have all your information together because you will only get **ONE** appeal. There is no appeal of the appeal. The appeal will be taken before a committee or a chair that decides on the outcome. They may not completely credit the bill, they may just cut it in half or they may say you're responsible for the whole thing. I don't see that happening in this case if you have all your information straight. 

The last bit of advice I can give you is to not ignore this. In America since the law was changed I believe in the mid 2000's it is damn near impossible for you to discharge from your student debt. It will follow you on your credit report, it will follow you from job to job. It can be discharged in bankruptcy, but the proof of ""undue hardship"" is extremely hard to prove, and most people keep them through bankruptcy. Eventually the school can garnish your wages. Please don't ignore this.

"&gt; My wife hasn't worked at all except for 2 years right after college 

She has too little work history to qualify for SSDI. SSDI is meant to function like an insurance policy where you pay in for a number of years and then collect if you lose ability to work.

&gt; She's too disabled for disability? Is there some other program that she would qualify for?

There is another program called SSI for low-income people who are disabled and were never able to work. SSI has more restrictions. It is means-tested meaning that you have to have assets below a certain amount to qualify. I think you would be best served by consulting a disability attorney to find out if your wife would be eligible for SSI.

"Adjudicator here (I read over the medical records, make the medical decision). There are two types of social security disability. SSDI (aka title II)... Think of this as a type of insurance that your taxes go toward. If she has not worked much in the last 5 years, she hasn't paid taxes, and therefore might not be eligible for this (local ssa office could tell you for sure). SSI (title XVI) is needs based. No work history necessary, but there are limits on household income and resources. Both types are evaluated the same, medically. Without reading her medical records,  I can't say whether or not she would meet the medical requirements.. There are MANY things considered. Everyone has conditions, it's the severity and her functioning that are evaluated. I strongly urge you to NOT get an attorney at this time. Think about it.. The attorney gets a percentage  of the back pay. Longer they drag the case out (and they absolutely do) the bigger the pay, bigger the percentage for them. If someone is represented, I cannot contact the claimant directly. I have to go through the attorney. The attorney decides what to share and submit. So many times, I have been close to allowing claimants shortly after they file, but due to them or their representative not returning forms or providing their doctors contact info, I am forced to deny them for failure to cooperate or insufficient evidence. Had there not been an attorney, I would have been able to call them for the info and likely allow them. So I'd suggest having her apply online. If she gets denied at the initial and reconsideration levels, THEN consider an attorney, as they can be helpful at the hearings level. Good luck!

"Yes, he needs to stop and think about cost basis.  Let's say he works out a deal where he pays off the reverse mortgage now and she transfers the title to him.

This, in most states' estate law, will transfer her cost basis to him.  If she bought it for $50k in 1973 and it's worth $400k now her old, $50k basis becomes his new $50k basis.  This means that when you go to sell it the $350k gain is taxable to you.  That's a lot of money!

In the vast majority of scenarios where you want to pay off the reverse mortgage it would be better for you to do so with a contract in writing that she will leave the home to you in her will.  If it passes to you in the will the probate process will place it in your name at its current cost basis.  The $400k house is on your ""books"" at $400k. Much better; you get the $350k ""free"" capital gains.

There are also interpersonal issues that may effect you and other beneficiaries of the potential estate.

"Generally, you will want to make a list of all of your expenses.  That includes rent/mortgage, utilities, cable/internet, insurances, loans, cellphone, etc.  Whatever you normally pay month to month.

Add up all of those expenses and then multiply it by 3 and again by 6.  That gives you range between 3 months of expenses and 6 months of expenses.

As an example, let's say you spend $2,000 per month.  You'll want to have an emergency fund of between $6,000 to $12,000.  This helps in worse situations where you lose your job and have no income.  It gives you upwards of 6 months to find a new one.

Depending on how stable you think your job is or how comfortable you want to be, you can slide that range around.  Maybe you want to be in between there at 4.5 months so you save up $8,000.

"Roth vs Traditional only applies to IRA accounts. There is no such thing as a ""Roth 401k"". A 401k is essentially the same as a Traditional IRA from a tax standpoint, except the contribution limit is much higher($18k vs $5500). 

Like /u/The_Phasers said, a 1% match isn't worth much. It would be better for you to contribute to a Roth IRA and get the tax savings later than if you went with a 401k and saved on taxes today(higher expected tax rate later vs low tax rate today). 

As for down payment vs retirement priority, a compromise between the two is probably best. When it comes to retirement savings, starting earlier is always better. Even 1 year of savings now adds up to huge amounts in retirement. You have to balance the immediate priority of a down payment against those potential gains. A few questions to think about in that balance:

* How much are you looking to save for a downpayment?
* How long to you have to save for it?
* Are you willing to take out a loan/early distributions from a retirement account to help with a downpayment?(Generally this is a bad idea, but may be helpful depending on your situation)

&amp;nbsp;

If you can afford to max out your Roth IRA contributions($11k per year for you and your wife combined) and save enough for the downpayment you want, that would be ideal. You will probably need to reduce the IRA contributions to get to your downpayment goal though.

"As a financial advisor, I have a couple thoughts for you. First, you need to decide what time horizon you want to dedicate your money toward. I understand that your goals are not very specific right now but you should avoid investing money that you plan on using in the next 3-5 years. The interest that banks are currently paying right now is very modest however an interest bearing savings account is best for money that you might use over this time frame.

Although my final comment isn't specially what you were asking for, I believe it is what I have to share that, as a 30 year old, would most beneficial over your lifetime. Understanding and becoming more comfortable with risk, specifically the dynamics of risk vs reward in the markets could make a tremendous difference over your lifetime. I'm sorry that I don't have any specific reference for you at the moment. But as an example, if you wanted to retire at age 60 with the same standard of living that you have today, you might have to save 3-5 times the amount of money held in cash compared to simply had a well balance investment portfolio. I hope this helps you in some way. Best wishes.

"Credit inquiries are one of the least damaging things to show up on your credit report. I wouldn't worry about it too much, especially if you were shopping for credit. 

&gt;Inquiries don't count as much as payment history, revolving utilization and other factors that contribute to the calculation of a credit score.

&gt;""A single inquiry typically impacts the score by one to five points,"" says Sarah Davies, senior vice president of analytics and product management for Stamford, Conn.-based VantageScore Solutions LLC. All three major credit reporting agencies -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- developed the VantageScore credit scoring model, which rolled out in 2006. Eight of the top 10 credit card issuers use it.

&gt; Multiple inquiries generated when rate-shopping for a mortgage, auto or student loan are consolidated by credit scoring models when done within a certain window of time. The FICO scoring model ignores mortgage, auto and student loan inquiries in the 30 days prior to scoring. Mortgage, auto and student loan inquiries older than 30 days are lumped as one inquiry whenever they fall within a 14-day span. Newer versions of the scoring model count the shopping period as any 45-day span. VantageScore lumps such inquiries that occur within a rolling 14-day window as one inquiry.

"I don't believe these types of mortgages exist. Banks make money two ways from mortgages:

1. Foreclosing 

2. Interest paid over years.

A 5 year mortgage more-or-less guarantees they won't get the big payoff from #2. 

Therefore, you're ALWAYS (I use always cautiously, but I think it's true) getting a 30 year mortgage with no prepayment penalty.

With 50% down, you'll be be in the driver's seat for negotiating. You want a low interest rate and no prepayment penalty. 

Now, you can pay off the loan at any time between ~1 and 30 years. If you lose your job, you have time with low payments to find a new one. If you pay it off in 5 years, you'll have paid very little interest.

"&gt; I don't know why but even during all of this, deep down inside I still want this project to succeed.

I went through something similar a while back. I was working for a small business I'd joined in the early days of it's life and helped build up.

We hit a rocky patch and my salary stopped coming through. Like you, I held on for far, far too long. A big part of that was because I wanted to help drive the business back into profit, but eventually it reached (actually it was beyond, really) the point where I had to walk.

At that point, I got given grief for ""giving insufficient notice"" amongst other things. Even then, I didn't go public with it, just got on with the new job and started chasing my backpay

It's damn hard to let go of something you've emotionally invested in, and that investment clouds your judgement.

Others have given you good advice on there here and now, so all I'll add is that you need to make sure you learn from the experience in the future. 

If you're ever again in a position where salary is even a few days late, start the process of looking for suitable alternative employment there and then.

"IANAL but i looked into this before for another person once who was the one who accidentally deposited the money into the wrong account. 

for that amount of money, someone's going to be looking for it. in australia, if the person who transferred the funds are from your own bank, the bank will most likely deal with it. if another company/person from another bank transferred the money, they will most likely request your bank to return the funds, which will to be handled by your bank's tracers and recalls department to confirm with you if this money is to be returned. if they cannot contact you, and your contact information is still unavailable to the other party (most likely due to privacy laws), i believe the other party will need to apply to the magistrates court just to obtain your details and ask for the funds to be returned. this will take some time, so i'd personally just keep it where it is. the other party's lawyers will then probably send you a letter to return the funds immediately, in which i'd have the bank's legal dept handle that matter (so you don't accidentally send the funds to another random account or wrong person.)

in the meantime, email the bank about the unexpected/accidental windfall deposit so you have in writing that you notified your bank (or record a skype call to the bank), and just sit back and collect the interest (but don't use it) until someone gets back to you. best situation is you can return just the money and keep the interest. maybe consider opening a new account for your actual funds and just keeping the windfall separate in the original account so you won't see it and get tempted into using it. if it's still there after 5-6 years, i'd talk to a solicitor about if there's a statute of limitation on these types of cases, and a possibility of keeping the funds after 7ish years?",null,null,null,erusko,null,null,1448878064,t5_2qstm,t3_3utixy,t1_cxhrivg,24,1450117541,0,0,cxhs4e5,personalfinance,24,null,null

"Actually in some countries, for example Germany, you can ""keep"" the money, if you can prove that you don't have it anymore. Now this sounds confusing and is actually a weird legal ""loophole"" (for the lack of a better word).

By law, if you recieve something that is not yours, then you have to return it to the owner, unless you don't own it anymore. This includes all goods (physical/digital/monetary). To keep accidentally recieved money, you just have to spend it. But the problem with money is, that all money is money if you for example recieve 400k and already owned 400k prior and now spent 400k, then you can't prove who those 400k originally belonged to. You would have to pay back the rest of the money you own (400k). Now the trick is to spend all of your money, now you can prove that you don't have the money that you accidentally recieved anymore, because you don't have any. Any money you earn after this will not be taken from you, as it is not the same money that you accidentally recieved.

This is a very specific case that is almost impossible to pull of, but it 100% legal.

"The money was transferred into your account in error.

Before realizing the error, the bank called you to let you know that you could be earning more interest on your balance if you moved it to a different type of account. This was most likely triggered by an automated process. The person who called you likely didn't look at your banking history or even pause momentarily to wonder whether the money was actually yours or not. They make the same call a million times a day.

The last paragraph of your post (where you mention your work/school status/expenses/etc) leads me to believe that you are, at minimum, passively wondering whether you can keep this money.

There is no way that you can keep this money. If you try, you will get into serious trouble with the law. 

If you have made contact with the bank to enquire about the source of the money and failed to mention that the money is not yours and was placed in your account in error, its going to appear as though you are attempting to steal it. Any fraud investigator who looks at that circumstance will be highly suspicious of your motives.

You mention being ""scared"". Call the manager of your branch immediately and explain explicitly that the money was placed in your account in error. If your parents are reasonable/rational people, let them know what is going on too.

If they're on the fence, let them know that you're not trying to get the money today. You're just trying to figure out who to talk to and which forms you need.

Why am I stressing IN PERSON? Banks have pretty strict policies about disclosing information, especially over the phone. However, if you're standing there with relevant documentation in hand, a bank manager (particularly at a smaller bank) may have some discretion in what to do (or may decide to help you anyway, even if it's against policy). If you make it clear that you're trying to do the right thing and are willing to wait a few days until they can check out your story, that will lend you even more credibility. 

They're not going to have information on a 15 year old account in the office. That's old enough that it might not even be computerized. Even if you're at the right bank, nobody will remember the event or be able to pull up the record at a moment's notice. This will require some digging. If you walk in knowing that, and make it as easy as possible for them by providing a copy of everything they need, they'll be more likely to help.

So the real answer to the question is ""it depends on where it's used"". Someone who knows English well will give that answer, while someone who only knows a few words might say ""no"".

Since this is PF and I have professional knowledge of this topic ([am architect](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1i0jh7/iama_architect_whos_main_interest_is_high/)) I'd like to add some insight on how to save money long term if you're building your own place and you plan on staying in it. So yeah, high jacking this comment.

Almost every house you see in the US is built from wooden 2x4s spaced 16"" (41cm) on center. The inside is covered in 1/2"" (13mm) gypsum, batt insulation is stuffed in the 2x4 cavity, the exterior is 1/2"" OSB/plywood/particle board covered with a vapor barrier (Tyvek wrap), then vinyl siding or some combination of brick or stucco is used for the exterior finish. This is the cheapest wall we know how to build and it's a pathetic excuse for a wall.

For almost nothing more upgrade to 5/8"" drywall. It lays flatter, is acoustically better, holds up longer in a fire, etc. If you're actually going to stay in the house forever then put up two layers. Use 2x6s spaced on 24"" (61cm) centers (advanced framing). Your insulation is deeper and there is less wood for thermal bridging. Your wall is about 2/3 stiffer and the R-value (insulation) doubles. For your exterior sheathing use thick plywood. Your house will be much stronger laterally and plywood doesn't fall apart when it encounters water. Invest in a good water/vapor barrier. I personally like the liquid applied ones but there are membranes and wraps too like zip system. It's all about sealing up penetrations like doors and windows. Now for the hard sell - exterior rigid insulation. Where do you where your coat? On the outside - yeah that's where your building wants it too since this way your structure doesn't experience outside temperatures. It also eliminates thermal bridging and keeps condensate off of your exterior sheathing. And last, build a rain screen or cavity wall if you like brick. It allows your wall to drain so moisture doesn't get trapped behind the walls and cause mold and rot issues. They also look nice if done well.

If you're really trying to go all out then look into ICF exterior walls or CMU with thick exterior rigid insulation plus rainscreen/cavity wall. Works everywhere and is the best wall you can reasonably build.

"Of these mostly bad questions, Number 2 is particularly bad. Repeating the question:

Well, the answer depends on my economic standing. If my income exceeds the price of ""the things I buy"", then inflation is my friend.

If I spend exactly every single dollar/euro/dinar of income on ""the things I buy"" then I don't give a shit about inflation.

If I am in the sad position where I spend in excess of my income on ""the things I buy"", then I will be contemplating suicide in 10 years, since I am even deeper in the red.

"Rental car industry accountant here.

A couple issues I haven't seen addressed, so I have some follow up questions.

Was the rental established through Hertz directly or through a third party (Orbitz, Travelocity, etc...)? If through a third party, was the rental pre-paid? If so, read through that service's contract to see if you can get a refund from them. Not all specifics of these prepaid rentals are guaranteed and it's not uncommon for comparables to be substituted.

If the rental was established through Hertz directly, it probably wasn't prepaid, so the rate of the actual car that was rented was agreed to by your wife. Check the contract to see if she was charged for a ""luxury"" car, or if she was correctly charged for for Ford Edge. It's not unheard of for SUVs to have comparable rates to smaller ""luxury"" sedans.

If you're okay with possibly not being able to rent from Hertz again, you can initiate a charge back with your credit card company. At best, you get a full refund and your CC company tells Hertz to pound sand. At worst, you're charged the full amount with no recourse and you're put on a Do Not Rent (DNR) list.",null,null,null,BoredAccountant,null,null,1447458673,t5_2qstm,t3_3sozwm,t3_3sozwm,35,1449787633,0,0,cwzgohq,personalfinance,35,null,null

"i decided to write on this post since we have pretty much the same point. i am a banker and have been for already 6 years. i delivered mortgages and loans to clients like you. From a bank perspective, 30% of your income is fine. but what you dont tell us is the other charges you have in your life ( do you have any dependant?, phone bills, education if applicables ...) if you are fine financially with 1600 per month i would say GO AHEAD. 
here is why:
- buying a house is an investment. just make sure the house is in a good area with potential to grow. use the city public information to see the value evolution of the house around your block. in 3 - 5 yearsm that house will be worth more and you and i will have a different conversation. 
- that house will help you get whatever you want from the bank. do you know that clients that have a mortgages with a bank can sometimes have their bank fee waived just because the bank dont want to lose them. Mortgage opens door when you always make your payments on time. 
one last advice, give the minimum deposit that you can give and keep your cash into your pocket. this must be surprising for you but the interest rates are very low right and we live in a country where finance governs everything. always keep some cash to yourself for emergency situation. finance at low interest rate as much as possible. even Tiger Woods has a mortgage when everyone knows he can pay cash the whole house. this is something the bank will never tells you but you will thank me later.

"Your best option is to start a business. It doesn't really matter what kind and the options are endless - finding a property you can purchase and rent out with a small cash flow is a great example.

I would take that 19k and try and find a home you can obtain for 5% down. Pick an area with low vacancy rates, that way you will have more applications to choose from. Do some minor renovations on the place to raise rent prices. The general rule of thumb should be 1% per month of the asset purchase price - so if you purchased the home for 120k, you would rent it for $1200 per month. You'd be surprised how many areas there are where you can make this work.

If you're not hot on real estate, you should look at other options, like holidays. Find an item you know people would purchase through the holidays (Candy, body washes, oils, candles). Figure out a way to manufacture in low volumes to avoid overstocking (and overpaying for inventory). Figure out a way to sell it - kiosks at malls are great if you can broker a cut of the sales rather than a monthly lease. Or you can give it to shops on consignment, and once they sell what's on their shelves, they take a cut and you take the rest.

Alternatively, you can find a business in the service sector. Start a cleaning company - find larger contracts and hire cleaners. So long as there is a margin above your payroll and your fixed costs are low, this business could cash flow.

Ultimately, this or literally any other business should beat whatever interest a 401k will give you. What's more, you can still find low-interest debt you can use to invest, and so long as you beat the interest rate, you're winning.

I am not a fan of passive investments. Especially heavily structured ones because the reality is...you'll never make enough to beat inflation or get rich with the capital you're currently working with. The only way is to leverage debt, and pick small businesses that will cash flow.

"Similar thing happened to me in my college days.  It's kind of hard to explain, but basically the student job pay rates had a base pay for the position and then you could get $0.25/hr increments depending on how long you had stayed on. Because of some confusion surrounding my taking a transfer position in the same department, I was given an extra mid-year increment that I was apparently not eligible for.  More importantly, I was told that I would be getting this increment, so I was not surprised when I got it.  I am honest enough to ask about getting an unexpected pay raise, but the pay raise was 100% expected.  Come contract time the following fall, the pay rate on the agreement was exactly what I expected it to be.  I signed, the university rep signed, I worked away all year.  
  
The following year, I go to sign and two things happen.  First, my pay rate for the new year did not reflect an additional increment you're supposed to get for completing a full year of service.  I inquired about this and the university rep (same rep from last year, I might add) told me I was at the max salary for the position.  I have no way to confirm that but considering I had worked in the department since the beginning of my freshman year and it was now my senior year, it seemed plausible and the pay was good either way, so I signed off.  
  
Then she says ""Actually, you worked for 3 semesters at $0.25/hour more than you should have been paid.  I'll let the first semester slide since it's more than a year ago, but we need to discuss how you will be repaying the overage from last year.""  
  
For some reason I always brought my previous contracts to these meetings. I never needed them before but it always seemed like it might be helpful to have them on hand in case I wanted to compare.  I didn't have to yell or get angry, I just pulled out that contract and said ""I signed this in good faith.  You signed it, too.  This was the agreed upon pay rate, and I was paid exactly that all year.  On top of that, this contract was fulfilled 4 months ago...it's a done deal.  There's no going back and I have no obligation to agree to a change in pay rate after the fact.  Do you still have your copy of this agreement on file?  If not I'd be happy to make you another copy...""

"I had a very similar thing happen to me. I went to my doctor's office for an IUD. My insurance paid the claim for my doctor to insert the IUD but not for the IUD itself because--essentially--the IUD came from the hospital's inventory (I went to a clinic that was unattached to a hospital, btw, but the clinic was owned by a medical system that includes 3 hospitals).

I appealed to my insurance and was denied. I filed a level 2 appeal and was denied. Then I took the matter to my state's board of insurance and they resolved the issue. My insurance ended up paying the $700 claim for the IUD. I got a letter from my insurance company that said paying this claim in no way says this was actually a covered benefit. Incidentally, it took 9 months from getting my IUD until the claim was finally paid, lol.

In all of my letters (2 appeals plus one to the state board), I put down exactly what happened. I went to xyz clinic, I got an IUD, insurance paid the doctor's fees but wouldn't pay for the device. I stated that I had no reasonable way to know the device wouldn't be covered because it came from hospital inventory. That I called on x and y dates before the procedure and was told the IUD was covered. I ended my letters with my expected resolution (""insurance pays this $700 claim). It was a pain in the ass, but worth my time to save the $700. I sent all letters certified mail, kept a copy of all correspondence, and kept a log whenever I spoke to someone by phone.

You'll find it takes 30-60 days to receive anything back from your insurance company. I think they have 90 to respond. If they don't respond within the time they are allowed by law, go immediately to your state's board of insurance (or whatever your state's insurance regulatory body is called). For my state, I was required to work it out with my insurance first so I exhausted their appeals process. It's a good idea to try to work it out with your insurance first anyway because it shows that you're not trying to waste the agency's time and that you made a good faith effort to resolve the matter before involving them.

Edit: Forgot to mention, I also requested the billing department at my clinic double-check that the billing codes were correct. I included that I requested that in my letters too. I think it's more of a check-this-box kinda thing, and in fact, the first thing my insurance suggested was that it was billed incorrectly (it wasn't).",null,null,null,stinieroo,null,null,1448391500,t5_2qstm,t3_3u33qp,t1_cxbiwjz,30,1449998463,0,0,cxbodsl,personalfinance,30,null,null

"So a couple things you should understand. 

Most debt collection works like this. 500 People owe a company a combined 500,000 dollars. Original company has given up on collecting it. 

They sell the legal right to collect that debt for say 30% (who knows what it might have really been) of what it is worth. So someone paid the original company 150,000 and are now chasing everyone down. 

This works to your advantage because anything they make over that 30% is profit to them. 

Therefore if you can dream up a plan that works, say 100 a month for the next 4 years. You might be able to say. I can pay 4800 total if you let me pay it out 100 a month for next 4 years.

"Sounds like this debt is old debt which is good news because that means they probably bought this debt for pennies on the dollar.

Don't ignore them but scrape up $1000 or $2000 and call them telling them you know you owe the money but just don't have it. You are barely making ends meet but would like to offer $1000 to settle the debt. 

But THIS is important so read carefully!! They will first decline but simply tell them (and be cordial even if they are not) that is all you have and when they are ready to accept then give you a call. If they start to cuss at you tell them quickly and firmly that you are willing to talk with them but will not be spoken to like that and if they continue you will hang up. And if it continues then hang up. They most likely won't sue because you don't have the assets or income to make it worthwhile. 

Then call them a month later and offer $1000 again. If they are rude then end the call. Then call a few weeks later and offer the $1000 again. Eventually they will probably take it. 

But, again, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!

1) Get in WRITING that they will accept the $1000 as FULL PAYMENT on the debt!! Without it in writing what they ""tell you"" doesn't matter. Tell them you need an email (and the email must be from the company email domain!!) or need a letter on their letterhead. BTW, don't EVER throw that letter out!! Keep in a file FOR LIFE!! That is your only proof of the agreement to settle for a lower amount.

2) Do NOT give them automatic access to your checking account. They will take every penny in that account. Tell them once you receive the offer to accept IN WRITING you will send a certified check (and purchase registered receipt meaning you get a confirmation it was delivered).

If you only can scrape up $500 now then offer that BUT you need to contact them. If they won't accept $500 tell them to call you in a month and you might be able to get a little more. Then when they call the next time tell them you have, say, $750 you can offer. But with old debt try to stand firm on about 10% to 20% ($1000 to $2000). But you should be able to get this cleared for about $1000. But don't forget the rules: Must be IN WRITING and do NOT give them access to your checking account.

I will also say, I live in Chicago and know many copywriters and 30-40k is pretty good. 45-55k might be the average salary, but I would be shocked to hear of someone starting at a new company as a Junior Copywriter, who makes more than 30k.

Can you explain where you got your idea of how much you should make? And it doesn't matter if you do the work of a senior copywriter, if you weren't hired under that title you don't get the pay.

"This may sound a bit skeezy, but a good way to reduce any type of service you have is to threaten to cancel. I have had this happen numerous times (not intentionally trying to reduce the bill). Most recently I called SiriusXM to cancel my radio subscription as I had found a deal through Groupon for a 3 month deal. During this phone call I was offered about 5 separate discounts and promotions and ultimately offered 3 months of free service, which I still declined as I did not want the hassle of making the call again.

Side note: During this conversation I made it clear that this service was supposed to be stopped and I should not have been charged for the next month as I had made a call prior. The man stated I had 'used the service' and I said 'well of course when I turn my car on my radio comes on'. He said he would be unable to refund me this charge and I said 'that is alright I just will not be recommending you or your company in the future'. I was promptly refunded.

EDIT: It's nice that this worked.  There's a life lesson in here somewhere - don't always jump to the worst with people.  Someone might not have had their coffee, might have found out their dog died or they have cancer, maybe you just misunderstood what they were saying... there are lots of reasons that people might seem brusque, demanding, or rude to you.  Instead of freaking out about this, it is often best to cut someone some slack and respond as if they had said something similar, but nicer.  The similar-but-nicer thing the boss might have said would be, ""Hey X, I noticed your contract is up at the end of the term, but I still have a lot of work to do.  Do you want to stay on until January to help me finish it?""  So you respond to that instead.

Over time, if someone is always a jerk, well, that tells you something about them.  But *anyone* can have a bad day or be misunderstood.  Don't jump to freak-out if you can avoid it.  Politely stand up for yourself.  It will work out better a lot of the time.  Not just work - this is even more true for personal relationships.

That's a false dichotomy. Are you able to afford your rent right now? If so, then you can easily stay in the Bay Area.

Your expections for the kind of house you can afford are not reasonable. It's also incorrect to assume that it's ""own or die"". 

You can't afford to buy that expensive of a house, and you won't be able to without more than doubling your current salary. Probably closer to 2.5x.

"I'll speak from personal experience - I was an amway kid growing up. 

My parents were heavily involved in amway. I stayed in hotels most weekends of my childhood while they were in seminars and buying tapes &amp; cd's of ""how to gain wealth"".

The products they sell are already sold by outlets like Costco &amp; Sam's club. There is not really a single product that Amway sells that there is not a better version of that is competitively priced.

The 170$ you pay is literally going to be lost immediately. They require that you usually have to buy a minimum amount of products a month to sell in order to not pay monthly fees. After about 10 years (me being 3-13) my parents finally gave up on Amway. It took 6 months for them to finally stop being harassed/charged by the ""company"" and no longer sink money into getting away.


The real kicker is Amway gets you hooked. They start you off with ""only small purchases you need"" or ""better business products"" and ""advice on running a small business"". Over time you'll come to realize all the ""seminars"" and ""clinics"" they have are not focused on your small business but only really about recruiting and selling more Amway memberships to other people. They get you hooked early with a small investment, and buying some products at lower prices than the store thinking that you can create a profit margin - problem is other larger companies have already beat you to that (IE walmart, costco, samsclub, target etc.). You'll never really be able to out compete or use enough of their products to be worth the money, but you'll keep investing more because ever ""seminar"" tells you how successful you are/could be if you just stick with the program.

TLDR; They're selling you on false hopes and dreams based on that you are naive and are a wishful thinker that will do anything to succeed. ",null,null,null,Seantheguy,null,null,1446821462,t5_2qstm,t3_3rr3up,t3_3rr3up,29,1449635741,0,0,cwqo50n,personalfinance,29,null,null

"Do not fucking do it OP. It is a pyramid scheme, and it is a cult. 

My coworkers are deeply indoctrinated into Scamway, and one of them brought me to a team meeting. I'm not joking when I say it's a cult, there is an energy that all of the IBOs (Independent Business Owners) have, and it's scary. They'll act nice to you, but it's all so they'll bring you into their business and send your money up through them. That's all they care about, they'll be in public, start a bullshit conversation with any random person or friend, and then steer the conversation right into the ""business"" opportunity. You make a share of the money anyone under you brings in, so everybody's looking out to suck people into their business. 

The business itself isn't actually **that** bad. You waste a whole lot of money on dumb shit like shampoo, beauty products, supplements, and admittedly the products aren't garbage, they're just massively overpriced. If you buy an Amway product from some zombie friend sucked into the business, whatever, you're fine, but don't actually spend hundreds of dollars on products and then push that shit on other people. The nature of the business is what's truly evil, that everything is a business opportunity, everybody's missing out on what you're doing and you're only doing them a service by bringing them in and making them future multi-millionaires too.

That's why you don't join Amway. Because you don't have friends anymore, you have targets, targets that you force to those stupid fucking meetings and extract money from. When you're indoctrinated into the cult you won't see it that way, you'll think you're doing them a favor, but from an unbiased perspective you are just some asshole pushing stupid products on people and bullying them into going to meetings.

My coworkers are always going to meetings after work. Every fucking day it seems. My one coworker just got back from a six day long trip, she forwent going to her actual job, that gives her actual money, just so she could waste money on the pipe dream. The money and the happiness is just a little further ahead! Keep investing into the business! Keep going to the meetings! You'll make it! It's just a little further ahead! But it never comes. 90% of Amway members **lose money**, and even if you do make a modest profit, you're wasting a fuckload of time going to mandatory paid meetings and alienating your friends.

If it sounds too good to be true, it is. ",null,null,null,A_600lb_Tunafish,null,null,1446822114,t5_2qstm,t3_3rr3up,t3_3rr3up,28,1449635986,0,0,cwqoiro,personalfinance,28,null,null
"My wife and I have been building our Amway business for about a year now. The way I look at it is this, would you rather pay a mortgage or rent for a home? Probably a mortgage because it creates equity and return in the long term even if the short term is more hassle/money. Our business works much the same. We are going to be buying these same products (vitamins, soft drinks, granola bars, etc.) from another source anyways so by owning my own business powered by Amway I am building equity in my consumer profile, I am establishing something that can in the long term pay out greater than what my short term investment is. I also work a 1099 job on the side, and so when I need stuff for it, like a ladder (it's a contracting job), or office supplies I also buy these through my business and make money back on them. More than if I had some credit card that gave me cash back, I've crunched the numbers. So this is one way to gain income back and the dual purpose of buying your own stuff is when I'm out in the world and people see the products I'm usuling, they tend to ask about them, so I let them try. I don't force sales on anyone but a lot of people genuinely love the products, love ordering them online and having them show up to their front doors, and all of my customers genuinely enjoy knowing that they are supporting my family, they know their purchase is helping to fund my daughter getting music lessons, or my wife staying home to school our children. As for recruiting people, a lot of times when someone likes the products and finds out I make money selling them, they are interested in following suit. So as far as the pyramid scheme goes, it's definitely not. Any organizational structure is going to be roughly pyramid shaped, look at any company there is normally a ceo/cfo under them a couple upper management types under them more middle management under them more lower management and under them even more actually workers etc. So yes it comes out roughly pyramidal in shape but as does any company. Here however no one is capped by the guy above them, and can at any point and time build themselves into a higher financial place than whoever brought them into the program. The idea is that the same way I can build equity in my consumer profile as well as sales outside of my needs (which are necessary for me to qualify for any compensation based on those ""below"" me) so can someone else and since I will be there helping hem figure out how to change their buying habits as well as how best to connect people to their businesses (as customers and/or prospects) that I get a training bonus (from Amway not from the individual). Ultimately it is about building a consumer team. That is where the money comes from. It's not cool, it's not sexy but it does build. As far as the cult thing goes, that is because in many circles the Amway groups promote high ethics and morals, they challenge what is mainstream and oppose it in many cases. The group I am apart of teaches a positive mental attitude, the power of words and the means to control your thoughts to purge negativity from your life. Most of my friends who have become alienates are that way because I don't care to listen to or watch or talk about the same stuff they do, because I've come to realize most of the world is very negative, and I do not want to be apart of that, I'd like to be a shining light bringing the world back to something beautiful and wonderful.",null,null,null,ltdiamond,null,null,1446822372,t5_2qstm,t3_3rr3up,t3_3rr3up,-7,1449636058,0,0,cwqooag,personalfinance,-7,null,null

"I would bet that none of these commenters have any experience with Amway itself. Let me give you some facts, from someone who's done it:
- Amway is a legit business with a very high rating from the BBB
- If it were a scam or a pyramid, it would've been shut done by the government because pyramids are actually ILLEGAL
-The people at ""the top"" don't make the most. Its the people who have personally influenced the most business who have, just like any sales job in any industry. 
- The products are actually AMAZING!  They actually produce the highest quality products in health,  cosmetics, and home care anywhere in the world! They invented the multivitamin for goodness sake.  Be a consumer of the products at VERY least, even if you're not interested in sales. 
- Correct, most people do not make money because most people look to get rich quick, then quit when they don't. I would recommend talking to someone who IS making a shitload of money (ask the guy who pitched you to introduce you to one) and ask them how they did it. There are tons of them, and some of the most quality people I've ever met. 
- The years you spend in the Amway business will teach you so many skills about how to be successful in life, it will likely make you a success in your daytime job, and will have a positive effect on the trajectory of your life, no matter if you stay in it or not.

While we'd always hear about how much the ""Diamond"" level people made, I came to eventually find out that most of their money was made selling... you guessed it. Motivational cassette tapes.

Nobody that I knew back then that did it still does it today. 

EDIT: after reading a few other replies, I feel compelled to add this. The products they sell aren't even competitively priced. And you're expected to buy the product (you have to set a good example for your ""downline""). I told my dad (my ""sponsor"") that the product was cheaper elsewhere. His response was, ""it's not about saving money. it's about making money."" (he was brainwashed... he's much better now). 

There was a big meeting in Florida (we lived in NJ), and everybody was expected to go. I told him that I didn't have the money to go. His response was, ""If you don't have the money, that's exactly why you need to go"". (he's much better now).",null,null,null,charliegriefer,null,null,1446824794,t5_2qstm,t3_3rr3up,t1_cwqltrc,22,1449636762,0,0,cwqq62d,personalfinance,22,null,null

I'm not sure what this means. Are you saying the manufacturer doesn't save money? If so, cool. I have no idea. That's not what OP was talking about.

True, which could definitely be taken into account. But that depends on the car etc etc.

""it's no longer an economic decision"" - 
I disagree. Since you just talked about saving gas, which is about money (unless you own a gas tree), it's definitely an economic decision.

None of your comments actually were related to what OP said. He said he refuses to pay more for an automatic. I know for certain that some cars are listed $X for manual and $X + $1000 (or whatever) for an automatic. So OP's statement is true. For some cars, adding the auto transmission costs more.

"&gt; Sounds like you are changing your story. You stated, ""Eviction laws are actually pretty favorable to the tenant.""

That's great! You out-lawyered the lawyer, seeing through my changing story, and proving your point! Obviously, despite not going to law school or taking a bar exam, you really showed this attorney what's what!  It's like a scene from a movie in which the charmingly, obviously-more-intelligent but down-on-his-luck layman beats the seasoned, stuffy attorney in a court of law, convincing the judge, jury, and everyone else that he's smarter than some bespectacled nerd. I'm clapping, sad that I was bested, but proud of you, your tenacity, and your intellectual prowess.

At least that's what I'd be saying if you hadn't misread and mistaken the original post for mine.

To clarify that wasn't me. ""Eviction laws are actually pretty favorable to the tenant"" was said by /u/iminyourasshole. I'm /u/thegirlleastlikelyto. I was the guy refuting your point and trying to be polite about it - ya know, saying you seemed like a contentious landlord (though contentious would include being able to read usernames, I'd think).

I was only replying to what you (yes, actually you, /u/Tampa-RE-investor) wrote: 

&gt; And secondly, why would a judge favor a renter that has not been paying rent? Open and shut case. Renter gets booted

I'd say in most jurisdictions laws favor the landlord. Withholding rent is one of the few cards a tenant has to play. As an attorney who has worked on landlord/tenant (both as a clerk in law school and after passing the bar) I think I know a little about what I'm talking about - more than enough to know that I wouldn't say tenancy laws favor the tenant - especially in my more conservative jurisdiction, Georgia. That said, I was only refuting the dumb statement you made - why would a judge favor a renter not paying rent, implying that there aren't circumstances where a judge would side with a tenant for not paying rent. You may have not seen such circs in your limited experience, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.

One thing that taught us in law school was to, ya know, read the text. The beautiful thing about reddit is that it gives people the impression that their ignorance is as good as someone else's knowledge. It's great you think that your experience as a landlord gives you more information than my law school, graduation, taking two bar exams (Georgia and California), and working in a ll/tt court and on tenants rights, but obviously that's not actually the case in the real world.

&gt; I'll come up with one exception for your side- where I live we have a military base. If I'm renting to active duty that gets called up for duty and they stop paying, as long as they are deployed I can't do shit. But like you say, this would be an ""extreme circumstance."" And as a military family I wouldn't evict anyway.

It's adorable you think I give a shit about any exception you come up with and about what you'd do.

"Aight man, let's break this down. Its really all gonna come down to what your goals are and better understanding the tradeoffs you are making toward reaching those goals with each option you can take.

**Option 1:** Status Quo

Your bonus is a nice perk but its not guaranteed, and not getting it should have little impact on your lifestyle. Let's leave it out of this.

After taxes you make: 72,019.95 / yr
http://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator/salary/result

your rent is about 34,800 a year not including utilities. 

That leaves about 37k to:

* Pay healthcare premiums and copays. estimate: 1500/yr

* Commute to work, and uber around city (get the clipper card). estimate: 3000/yr. I'm assuming you don't have a car, because that is the smart play living in SF.

* Groceries. Estimate: 4000/yr

* Internet/phone/utilities. Estimate: 1500/yr

* Netflix/gym/other subscriptions: Estimate: 500/yr

* Going out (there is no point in living in the city if you don't enjoy the restaurants, coffer shops, and bars and stuff like this on offer).
Estimate... 3-15k/yr (depends on your habits. 3k is super low this would assume you pack your own lunch everyday for work and barely go out).  

* Travel. Estimate: 1-10k/yr

* Buy cool shit (remember bday's and christmas). Estimate: 500-2k/yr

* Subtotal at this point: 16-37.5k/yr in non-rent expenses...

With what you have left over you would want to:

* Save for other things like potentially buying property in the bay area (which probably requires having at least &gt;150k stacked up for a down payment on 1 br, and even then you'll surely be out competed several times for places you want).

* Save for retirement (this will actually bring your take home amount up due to tax advantages, but lets not over complicate things)


**Option 2:** Try harder to find a roommate

Rent can easily get down to 1500 (well maybe not easily). This would save you about 16k, which would at least double what you manage to save every year.

**Option 3:** Live in Oakland or the east bay where rent is cheaper

Draw back here is that its harder to transition to other jobs on the peninsula or southbay if you ever wanted to.

This should save almost as much as option 2. 

**EDIT:** 
If I were you I'd just bite the bullet and find a roommate. It will not lower your standard of living that much for what you'll get out of it and it could take you from saving 16 to 32k a year, (not including bonus). 32k/yr in savings will create so many opportunities for you... in a few years you could buy property or take a sabbatical and travel around, or move to another part of the country and be rich. Or you can keep chugging along with the knowledge that your hard earned cash isn't just evaporating.

"Hi, this seems to be your first job and first foray into paying taxes and such. I just want to make sure that you understand that you are not paying 39% in income taxes - there are a lot of misconceptions about this, and I certainly didn't understand when I got my first job. That 39% is the **total tax bracket** that you are in for combined CA and federal taxes. You are paying 28% for the amount of income that is over $90,751 to the US govt, and 9.3% for the amount of income that is over $50,870 to California. For every bracket of income below that, you pay whatever the designated amount is in taxes for that bracket. **So in total, you pay less than 39% in income tax.** Excuse this explanation if you already knew that.

Related to the question you are asking - the rule is in place to help people budget their expenses. Have you budgeted for your expenses?  ADP provides a salary-taxes-other deductions calculator: http://www.adp.com/tools-and-resources/calculators-and-tools/payroll-calculators/salary-paycheck-calculator.aspx. From this tool, you can see your rent is half of your take-home pay. 

The rest of your budget includes ""fun"" money, savings, emergency funds, car insurance, car payments, cell phone bill, utilities, groceries, eating out, drinks, etc etc. Make sure you are being realistic! Once you do that, and you find that you have enough money to comfortably live even while paying $2900/mo in rent, you're fine.",null,null,null,thatotherotter,null,null,1448223344,t5_2qstm,t3_3tubwn,t3_3tubwn,24,1449957716,0,0,cx9bb2j,personalfinance,24,null,null

"This is going to sound forceful, however I feel that strongly about it. What you are talking about scares me.

Do not ever, ever, ever, ever (is this clear yet) buy a house in which you must pay PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance). You're effectively paying for an insurance plan because the bank doesn't believe you can/will pay off your mortgage. If the bank isn't willing to take the risk, **you shouldn't either**.

You should also not attempt to buy anything that is more than 25% of your take home pay. This will ensure that even if times get tough, you can still afford to live there. That is on a 15y mortgage. Do not do a longer one. 30y mortgages are basically all interest for the first 2-3 years with very little principal headway.

You should save whatever you need (generally 20%) to avoid PMI, at a minimum. If your income is semi-random, as it sounds like yours is, you should have a very large emergency fund saved up to help you through the slumps.

Please don't buy a house now. Save up and pay for it (at least 20 as you asked, and possibly a great deal more depending on what your rent is currently vs your expected mortgage payment, etc).",null,null,null,Blailus,null,null,1448223641,t5_2qstm,t3_3tu4m3,t1_cx9atpk,-8,1449957806,0,0,cx9bi3h,personalfinance,-8,null,null

"Disclaimer: none of this should be taken as legal advice. Im just sharing my story, anything you choose to do, you accept the risk for.

Run a credit report with the three companies. Send three challenge letters for each hit on credit, at each company, a week apart. A challenge letter is basically stating a request for proof that you're responsible for the debt.

(CreditBureau#1) - each hit gets 3 letters, once a week for three weeks. Keep copies.

(CreditBureau#2)...

(CreditBureau#3)...

Once this is done, you will have:

A) Established you're current debt level (this is important, explained later). 

B) Forced the credit bureau to produce proof of debt ownership.(if they can&amp;do add it to your debt list, if they cant they will take it off of your credit, and you will know not to count it against you).

Next step: Bankruptcy ;)

Get and fill (don't file) the bankruptcy paperwork. At this point you are going to do everything you would be doing to file for bankruptcy, just not actually submitting or filing the paperwork.

You are doing this in an attempt to prepare for bankruptcy, but wanna give it one last chance to settle before you do...because bankruptcy is only for when no any other option is available.

Next. Take that list of claimed debt, call them up and say.

""Hey my name is 'Name"", my acct # is '#'.... Ive been trying to work with y'all on managing my debt for years, I wanted to, out of courtesy notifiy you of my wife&amp;I's intent to file for bankruptcy, my file number is '#'.(this # will be on your official un-filed bankruptcy paperwork).""

At this point they either say Ok and hang-up.(if they do, they'll mark in their system thats what you're doing and may have someome contact you in the near future to settle or to follow-up on your bankruptcy case, which you havent done yet. 

Or... They will say... Well im sorry to hear that, it's a shame we weren't able to work that out...what did you owe??? Then they will usually offer you 35-40% off your bill. 

Don't take it!

Even if you have to hang up..they will start sending you settlement requests...after 6mon-1yr...you can get it up to 70+% off your bill.

The motivation is that if you file for bankruptcy they get nothing, better 25-30%...than nothing.

Good luck

"The answer is yes, it's called gearing or leveraging your return and its typical in real estate.  Here is the simple explanation.

An apartment building sells for $20 million and it earns $2 million per year in rent.  2 / 20, this is a 10% return. 

You borrow $15 million and pay $500k interest per year.  Now, instead of having invested $20 million, you're only investing $5 million of your own money.  $5 million earns you the $2 million per year in rent, deducting the $500k in interest expenses, meaning that $5 million earns you $1.5 million per year.  1.5 / 5, this is a 30% return.

By borrowing money in this case the investor is able to turn their 10% return into a 30% return.

Leverage is a double-edged sword, though.  Suppose there is a big maintenance issue or rent comes in far below expectations, and the building only earns $250k.  On $20 million, this is a 1.25% return.  Pretty abysmal.   But on the leveraged return, it's -$250k / $5 million, or a -5% return.  Way worse! Leverage magnifies the good but also magnifies the bad, and a wise investor uses it sparingly.

Also, at the real estate private equity firm we used gearing.  Especially because we were building energy efficient buildings in Germany which means that we were eligible for KfW financing which is like interest-free loans from the government for revitalizing old buildings with new eco-friendly ones.  So we would borrow money from the government for 0% interest, use it to construct many tiny student dwelling units (the amount of funding we were granted was based on the amount of individual units we were building, not how large the units were... so a 90 sqm unit qualified for the same financing as a 26 sqm unit as far as KfW was concerned), and make up the difference with investor funds.  Then we sold the student dwellings to individual investors off piecemeal in the complex.  After KfW financing was repayed, 70% of the proceeds went to the investors, and 30% went to myself and the other partners of the firm.

Without gearing, the return for investors would have been roughly around 8 - 11%.  With gearing we were able to get an IRR for investors of about 26% per year.  

Hope this illustrates how leverage is used in real estate and investing in general!

You have $6,250 in your old 401(k). Assuming you withdraw it all, you will have to pay a 10% penalty on the $6,250 which will be $625.

Then you will have to pay taxes on it. You are somewhere near the cusp of the 15% and 25% marginal tax brackets, so I am going to go with the assumption that all of it will be in the 25% tax bracket. That is .25 * $6,250 = $1,562.50 in federal taxes.

I don't know the tax brackets for New York, but let's say your marginal bracket is 5%. That means that .05 * $6,250 = $312.50 goes to state taxes.

That means you will actually get:

$6,250 - $625 - $1,563 - $313 = $3,749

"I'm in the Midwest too and $1,500 is enough to buy a car that'll do the basics for you.  I do it all the time.  It is not going to be an attractive car - it's going to have rust, dents, scratches and gremlins.  It may smell weird inside.  Don't let those things deter you.  When you're buying a cheap car, that isn't what matters.  

Firstly, when looking at cars for sale - I assume you'll be checking Craigslist, and don't be afraid of it, either - make sure that there's pictures posted and more than one at that.  It's 2015.  There's no good excuse for somebody to be incapable of photographing a car they're trying to sell, and if there's no pictures, that's because it's a pile of shit.  Move on.  Make sure the post is written in more or less decent English and make sure it contains relevant info, or that the person you're contacting can give you good info on the car.  If they say shit like ""I'm selling it for a friend"" or ""I haven't had it long enough to know,"" move on.  Be positive they have a clean title in hand that is in their name.  No title?  Move on.  

Once you're going to look at a car, make sure that you listen to it run for a while.  Motors can sound fine when cold and hellish once they're warm.  Take it for a substantial test drive.  Make sure it shifts okay (manual or automatic), that there's no major lights on (check engine, oil pressure), and that it steers straight.  Make sure all the gauges work unless you're comfortable going without them.  Make sure to pop the hood and check the oil - make sure it isn't black, sludgy or full of metal flakes and isn't over or under filled - and check the coolant levels.

Check with the back of your hand if the hood/engine are warm before the seller (or you) start the engine.  A car that starts easily from completely cold is a good sign.

"I have bought a bunch of beater cars so I have some advice.

You have three basic options Toyota, Honda, Saturn. Those cars tend to last way past 150k miles. Toyota and Honda last to 300k and Saturn is a 250k+. 

Here is what you are looking for:    

* You want a car, not a truck or SUV (both of those tend to be used harder).    

* Take any car your interested in to a mechanic. Anyone selling should let you do that and and full service shop will look a car over for $50 - $90. Some might do it for free. If you can't afford that then take a car your interested in to any auto parts store and have them check the computer in the car for codes. Also tell them you are thinking of buying it and they might let you know about some red flags.

* You want as low miles as you can get, keeping in mind that you are going to end up with a car close to 200,000 miles for 2k.    

* Pay attention to the body of the car, a car with more rust is probably going to have other problems.

* You want an automatic car. Not a manual. Clutches in old cars end up needing to be replaced more often than not ($400 - $600).

* Check tire tread, that's $400 more for tires all around and you might be able to drive the price down for new tires.

* Drive it and make sure the alignment is close to good (no stiff pulling one way or another). An alignment that is way off is $100 to fix and may also be a sign of failing joints etc (Depending on which joint $200-$400 + alignment) Thanks to /u/ezSpankOven for noting previous price was incorrect..

* Use the overdrive (see my edit) on the car (go up a steep hill) or see how fast you can get to 70 mph. If the transmission shifts really hard that could be a red flag for either engine mounts going bad (that's not the worst thing in the world and is still drivable) or a bad transmission. You will need a mechanic to confirm which (Bad tranny is $1500, engine mounts are around $200 if I remember right but a car is still drivable with bad engine mounts).

* A big one is find out when the timing belt/chain was replaced. If they don't know then google if the car has a belt or chain. A chain can last the entire life of the car, a belt is a 60k to 90k replacement needed and not knowing is bad. I don't know how much a timing belt cost to replace as I don't buy cars with belts.

* Check the oil, if it is low or dark then you might have a oil leak or it burns oil. If it burns out that nbd as most old cars do but make sure you check the oil on a regular basis if you buy the car. (I carry oil around with me cause mine burns oil (about 1 qt every 2 months))

* Check the age of the battery (if you don't know how google it, it's really easy). If it is older than 3 years then keep in mind you will need a new one soon ($80 - $130).

* I tend to buy 4 cylinder cars. I find they are great on the gas mileage and people sell them cheap. People also (I think, I have no proof of this) drive them more carefully.

* Any car you get you need to drive like it is about to break. That means not running at high rpm's to much, taking more time to get from 0-70, and overall just driving softly.

* Your interior is going to be worn, accept that is the case. 

* Take a deep wiff when you get in the car, anything is smells like now will stay (smoke or mustiness)

* If they have the records for the car ask for them before you buy so you can see the maintenance.

Some people won't like this advice but here it is. It you are an attractive women you might get be able to get a lower price on the car if you don't tell your story and just say you have X dollars for a car (assuming the person selling the car is a guy). If you don't think that will work then bring your husband for the sale. A good cop/ bad cop can bring the price down $100 - $200 dollars. Of course you don't need to do that at all if the price is fair.    

If you have any questions feel free to ask me. Every car I have bough has been under 3k and most last me 2 or 3+ years. 

EDIT: So after reading some comments I realized I was mis-using terminology. I refer to a car downshifting to a lower gear as overdrive. This is of course wrong. So when I say don't run it in overdrive I really meant don't run it at high rpm's for a long period of time.

"I work in higher education.

From your previous comments, it sounds like this is your timeline. Please correct me if I am wrong:

1. You planned to attend university A. Your advisor enrolled you in classes. 
2. University B offered you a scholarship so you accepted their offer to attend. 
3. You emailed your advisor about withdrawing. 
4. Your advisor did not respond, so you took no further action. 
5. At a later date, you found out about the formal withdrawal process and took action. 

Here is the important question:

When you completed the formal withdrawal process, did you do so *after the actual start of classes at university A?* If so, your school  may be billing you because they are applying the school's refund policy. This goes into effect when a student withdraws after the beginning of a term. For example, at the university where I work, if you attend one day of class in a term and then withdraw, you are still held liable for 20% of your tuition. 

You are going to need to prove that you withdrew from the school prior to the start of the term. I would suggest that you follow the advice of /u/mrozz and try to get in touch with a higher-up regarding the problem. The school has every right to be a jackass and claim that you didn't complete the formal withdrawal process in time, even if you didn't know about it, if it is outlined in the Student Handbook. That said, university deans and presidents aren't going to want the bad publicity that comes with taking a student to collections who never even stepped foot in the door.

"That's not quite true. The type of business is a ""sole-proprietorship"", which according to every law, accountant, and financial advice site I've found says is legally counted as an individual according to the IRS, and not a business, and able to use ""personal"" accounts. It's technically business conducted by an individual. Technically, anyone who has a 1099 is also a ""business"" as well, so any freelancers or contract employees are just the same.

We do have an accountant, and they've been handling our returns for the past couple of years we've been freelancing and selling online.

"That's taxes, as far as I'm aware there are ZERO laws that require ""personal accounts"" to not be used for individuals who are sole proprietors. 

According to what ally said to me, banks who do this do so purely to avoid the chance of a corporation using a bank account.

In a later conversation, they did say that banks that offer business accounts can allow personal accounts to be used for sole proprietorships.

Here's a bunch of sources that state why this is not a legal requirement, and you calling an individual who sells online a ""business"" is just a semantic argument, and should have no effect on their bank accounts:

http://www.carefulcents.com/checking-accounts-for-solopreneurs/

&gt;Please note; you don’t necessarily need to open a “business” checking account if you’re a sole-proprietor. In the eyes of the IRS, a sole-proprietor isn’t a legal business entity like an LLC or INC business is, so you can save money by using a personal account for business purposes.

&gt;The main reason for this is because my business is still small enough so it doesn’t make a huge amount of income every month. This also allows me to avoid the costly monthly fee that’s usually associated with a business account.

&gt;UPDATE: Ally Bank was originally listed as a great bank but after doing some research, and receiving comments from other freelancers, it’s no longer a recommended bank for small business owners. They are however great if you’re using a checking account for your household funds or other personal needs.

Basically, while having separate accounts is a good idea, they requirement that it must be a ""business checking"" account if you are a sole-proprietorship is completely due to a banks individual policies, and 0% due to the IRS or any laws.

The accountants I've spoken to and websites I've found say there is no tax requirement that the accounts be separate. And since we've been doing extensive bookkeeping of all the profits and expenses, having separate accounts wouldn't really give us any new information.

&gt;I also think you should also look into forming a LLC for your business/freelance work. And you should then cut yourself a paycheck with taxes taken out to make things way easier.

We've been considering this, but our accountant has been saying that at this point there's no benefit that makes it worth the nearly $800 per year cost of having a corporation. Not to mention you have to pay taxes on the businesses income, then taxes when you pay yourself with the money.

"Holy shit there's a lot of misinformation and just downright terrible advice in here. I would only accept the military offer if you want to be in the military first and a physician second. /u/ArmyOrtho made a great post a while back and I'll post it here.

""ugh.
Where do I start?
Ok, yes, your math is close enough to being accurate to be considered ""correct"" in one certain situation.
If you match internal medicine (or pediatrics), and you match directly into a residency program, and you attend a private medical school which costs in excess of $200,000 of tuition for four years, and you take out no loans during those 4 years to live off of, and you serve only your 4 years after residency, then your lost income math applies (poorly).
But, here's reality:
For your math argument to work, you have to commit to a primary care specialty before you even start your first day of school. As most of us change our minds time and time again throughout the 4 years of school, you won't have that luxury. You made your call the summer before your 1st year.
Now, how about that internal medicine spot you wanted? You're Air Force HPSP. Let's say for sake of argument, that they only need 25 graduating medical students to fill their needs for internists. You don't make the cut. You don't match. You had absolutely no idea this was very likely because the branches of the military do not routinely broadcast their expected needs before they match applicants. This is a decision made by the individual consultants to the surgeons general in each service. So, now you scramble.
The military has the capability of granting you a deferment to attend a civilian residency program. Again, their willingness to do so is based entirely on their forecasts of how many of each type physician they will require over the next several years. This is not at all likely to happen (in Army Orthopaedics, it's happened exactly twice in the past 20 years). So, you are now a graduating medical student obligated to serve 4 years after medical school, but you have no residency to go to.
Now, you get to attend a transitional internship for a year (neither incurring nor paying back any previous obligation). After that, you compete again for a residency spot, or you go to the Line. You become a General Medical Officer and spend the next 2-3 years doing routine physicals on soldiers, sailors, and airmen until such time as you are either accepted into a residency program, or you complete your obligation and leave military service (having never completed a residency program).
But, the military is well practiced at this. They'll send you to a transitional internship, then 2-3 years as a GMO leaving you with a single year left on your contract before you're all said and done. This is when you get your offer. You take it, because it's the residency you've been waiting for for the past 3 years, but you realize only too late that the residency itself incurs a service obligation. One for one. But, this is served at the same time as the HPSP obligation. Problem is, you paid most of that off already, so now you start fresh. 3 years after residency, and it took you 3 years to get that residency. Your 4 years of service just blossomed into 6.
Fellowship? Add two more years after year-long fellowship (for a total of 3 more years in uniform).
So, who're the biggest culprits of this? Answer: The Air Force, and the Navy. Why? Because they need GMOs (flight surgeons) more than anyone else. Guess who's got the biggest signing bonuses? You got it. The Air Force and the Navy. And this is the reason why.
I've been doing this for 17 years. I have my likes and dislikes but I am by no means disgruntled. There are many, many wonderful reasons to serve in the military, both as a physician and otherwise, and I encourage each and every graduate to give it sincere thought, but in the VAST majority of cases, it is a poor financial decision.
If you went to a military academy, or you are attending USHUS (or God forbid both), then there is absolute no way you can spin the numbers to make it a sound financial investment.
As for the list of professions that make less than $180,000 a year in private practice, I would refer you to /r/medicine to ask them about the accuracy of the medscape data you're quoting.
To put another way, I will make more money in my first year of private practice than I did in all 4 years of my military practice IN ADDITION to the money I made as a resident.""",null,null,null,rotorcloud,null,null,1446924451,t5_2qstm,t3_3rwojx,t3_3rwojx,172,1449659704,0,0,cws20sj,personalfinance,172,null,null

"Graduating med school and former military here.  Also had offers for HPSP and USUHS.  I don't think you paid close attention to what HPSP actually is.  What they want in return is not for you to ""basically practice in a VA""  You will be active duty military.  They want a year for every year of school that you will pay back AFTER your residency is finished.  Also, you will not exactly be limited to military residency, but definitely shuttled in that direction unless you can't get one.

Things you need to consider about military medicine is that depending on what you want to do, you may have little to no chance (or no chance at all) of getting into it.  Residencies are granted based on academics + prior service/awards/points etc.  So if you want something competitive like Ortho/Ophtho/Derm/surgical sub-specialty you probably won't get it.  Well that may be too far but you are fighting a large uphill battle (of what is already an uphill battle anyways).  I would also say that you may think you know what you're interested in now but that will likely change during med school.  

This is the most important part.  Money...is NOT a reason to go into military medicine.  Anybody that says otherwise is either trying to get you to sign up or is not familiar with the territory.  Your autonomy and skills development will be 2nd rate to your civilian counterparts, and your income as an attending physician is a fraction of what it will be on the civilian side of the house.  Your income lost to military salary will far exceed any loans+interest you accrue in medical school.

I highly advise you to go to the military forums on SDN, as you can meet many practicing military physicians there and get a better idea than asking personal finance.  Most military physicians I know are disgruntled and are getting out as soon as they can.  Many are stuck for 10+ years paying time back for specialty + subspecialty training whilst treating a patient population that is, compared to the general population, healthy.  You will deal with more bureaucracy in mil-med than the civilian side, and often your duties as an officer will often trump your duties as a physician.  This may be reflected in your professional development as a doctor compared with your civilian counterparts.

Think very hard about this.  I'll link the forum below.  If you want to serve, that's fine I get it.  If you want to be a military physician that's great.  But DO NOT go into this without knowing exactly what you are getting into.  This is a terrible decision to make based on money.

I wish you the best of luck.  Enjoy med school it's awesome.

"Good question! Trying to decide if you need life insurance, then deciding if whole or term is best can be a hard question if you don't know much about life insurance.

The key is to look at why you ""need"" life insurance. Make a list of all your obligations or wants your loved ones would have if you passed away and what they would cost. Do you have a mortgage or other loan your spouse would be stuck with? Do you want your spouse to not work for X amount of years? Do you want to pay for your kids college? What about funeral arrangements? Make a list of all these obligations and their costs.

Now make a list of all your assets and add up their value. This would be savings, investment accounts, retirement accounts, life insurance at work, and more. Basically anything money that could be used to pay the above obligations.

Take your obligations/wants and subtract your assets. If your obligations/wants outweigh your assets then you might want to consider to get term life insurance to cover your gap. Term life insurance is suggested for younger people as your obligations and assets change over your lifetime. At 25 you might not have a home or kids, but at 35 you might have both and more! In that case your obligations would be higher at age 35 then at age 25, requiring more insurance. You can get one term policy or layer the term policies as your obligations increase. For example, say you need $100,000 in insurance at 25, you get a 15 year policy. At age 35 you need $400,000, you already have $100,000, so you can get another $300,000 with 10 to 15 years worth of coverage. at age 40 (when the $100,000 policy expires) you can decide if you insurance needs have increased or decreased from $300,000.

Whole life insurance might be more appropriate if your are in retirement as your obligations and assets are fairly set at that point in your life. The house should be paid off, you won't have to replace ""income"" form working, and you shouldn't have too many other obligations. One thing they always try and ""sell"" younger people on is the fact you can ""borrow"" from the policy's cash value. But in this case it might be better just to save the money yourself as the amount your saving wouldn't be subject to administrator fees and more. 

If you find that your assets outweigh your obligations then you probably don't need life insurance.

I wouldn't consider the cash value a ""safety net"", instead work to build an emergency fund to cover these unexpected expenses. If you're looking for an investment, look into ""why you want to invest"". For example, say you want to ""invest"" for retirement, there are specific accounts (401k or IRA or Roths) that have better benefits than a whole life insurance policy. If you want to save for your kids college, again, there are much better accounts to have this money grow and benefits for when you use the money for that purpose. If you just want to invest for investment sake, consider a managed fund or even opening your own account at a financial institution.

Good that you started with a emergency fund.
For the 10k I would suggest to put them in a balanced stock/bond portfolio. I would go for 90% stocks and 10% bond.

Your big issue is timing.... probably we are going to face 1 or 2 years of bear market, thus if you enter the market now you would be in loss and even if in 10 years you will see profit it't not going to be easy from a psychological point of view.

Frankly speaking I would be scared to enter the market now with all my capital, you can consider to enter now with 3k, 3k in 6 months and other 3 in other 6 months, this way in a bear market you can get an average price.

I suggest you to try to simulate your portfolio in the past years and check if you can psychologically face losses.

"First thing I would do is look around for some financial aid packages. Often times Universities don't advertise them but if you are persistent and have a story (which you do) they should give you some extra money. 

Since you are not legally allowed to work I would suggest finding a corner store that needs some extra help and striking a deal where you get paid under the table. I have personally done this many times in the past when my family was running low on money. Its not much money, but when you're in a bind anything helps.

You mentioned your brother had graphic design skills. Get him on Olance, Edesk, Freelancer, Upwork any of those websites. He can apply for projects for free and get paid. In the beginning he will have to work for very low amounts to build a reputation but once he has it built he can make a decent wage on the side. While the beginning is rough, its better than nothing. 

Finally, you need to pick up some skills outside of work. It seems - based on your debt situation- that you may be in this position for a while. You need to put in the work outside of class and work (assuming you go the corner store route) to pick up skills that can benefit you with making real money.

The route to financial freedom is very difficult. When I came to this country with my parents we had $500. For 7 years we didn't know what a weekend was. Every day was a combination, for me, of work, school, babysitting and picking up skills. Its difficult but very rewarding. Your parents are already working hard and you can do it as well.

"This is 100% correct. You need to consult an attorney and let him or her handle this situation. There are laws that dictate how an estate is handled when someone passes without a will, and this can change depending on the amount of the assets held. 

To handle this yourself is highly inadvisable because there is so much to know, and not doing it yourself will allow you to handle the other arrangements without everyone bickering over money. 

Let the attorney figure out what debts may be owed by the estate, and know that you cannot personally inherit that debt, so don't just go paying the bills all willy-nilly. Also, not all debts are created equal - tax debt is different from unsecured debt, etc. Attorneys spend a lot of time learning an immense amount of specialized knowledge for this very reason - way too much info for a layperson, including myself, to fully know or understand. It blows my mind how much there is to know on any given legal topic.

In that case, the strip embedded into the paper is still there, and you have to actually LOOK and read the denomination to know that it's a fake (Although, technically it's also genuine as well). 

The newer bills are trying to fight that kind of thing though, Looking at the new 100's I have from the Casino they have the thin strip embedded with ""USA 100"", as well as a HUGE holographic strip with ""100"" as well. Then there's also the watermark, as well as various other security features like the metallic printing on the lower right.

TBH--It sounds pretty unlikely that the bank would have issued fake bills like that. You'd be unlucky to get two $100's that are fake...but OP says he got both a $100 and a $50. As I mentioned before, the counters in use at many banks will ""shit out"" any fakes...so that means that it must have been given to the cashier by a customer (Both the 100 and the 50) and given to OP without going to the counting room.

With all that information--Really the only possibility is that a customer gave the teller those bills and deposited the money into their account, or got an instrument of some sort (A cashiers check, let's say). If that's the case then in all probability OP wasn't the only customer to get the fake money. If a second customer reported the fake bills (Assuming that the cashier caught it) then that might have caused the bank to change their mind, review the tapes and see that both of the customers with fake bills made withdrawals on the same day, at the same cashier, and behind someone who just happened to make a large deposit in 100 and 50 dollar bills. 

I SERIOUSLY doubt it worked out like that...but to be honest it wouldn't be hard to figure it out. If it was less than $500 then the bank will probably eat shit and not care. If it was a bunch of fake bills then it would be worth it to watch the video and count how many bills went in, and how many went out of the drawer between customers. 

Some businesses are so large that their LP departments focus on the big losses (IE: $100,000+)....others will come down hard on employees for being $10 short in a drawer.

"Your girlfriend needs to rethink what kind of lifestyle she can afford.  She has a lower net worth than most people living in poverty, but wants to buy organic food, spend $150 a month on a cell phone bill, and own a $26k+ car?  Her debt isn't insurmountable, but your girlfriend needs to pay a lot more than the minimum each month in order to climb out of debt.  She needs to increase her income if possible, with a better job or a second job, and she needs to dramatically cut back on her expenses.  

Things she can do starting this week:

- Cut back on grocery spending.  She can't afford organic, and healthy food doesn't have to be expensive.  She should be able to live on $200 a month for groceries, not $400.  

- Switch to a much cheaper phone plan with a discount carrier like Cricket.  $35 per month is much more reasonable.  

- Create a budget that will allow her to dedicate at least $1000 per month to debt repayment.  I suggest she give herself a small allowance ($100 per month?) to spend on eating out, clothes, and entertainment, but any other luxuries should be cut at least until the credit card debt is gone.  She needs to live like a broke college student. 

- Look up how much her car is worth and see if she can sell it for more than what she owes.  A $26k+ car is way, way too expensive for someone who is worse than broke.  It would be much better if you two could get by with just one car, but if that isn't possible, she needs a $5k car, not a $26k car.  

- Start applying for second/ better paying jobs. ",null,null,null,clearwaterrev,null,null,1447626390,t5_2qstm,t3_3sxk3v,t3_3sxk3v,30,1449820657,0,0,cx1dn58,personalfinance,30,null,null

That said my credit union miscalculated my interest for the first year I was with them.

"I think you're looking at this the wrong way. You want to find a way to pay off your loan faster so you can live again. How about instead paying off your loan *slower* so you can live again?

I understand it's great to pay down debt as quickly as possible, but it shouldn't be at the expense of your life. You could easily make a feasible two- or three-year repayment plan, which is still a very reasonable timeframe to pay off $30,000 -- most people couldn't even do that -- that frees up enough money to do other things in your life. Should you find a job that provides for more income you could change your plans to pay off your debt more aggressively.

The problem with your envisioned investment strategy is that one year is just too short of a timeframe. Sure, if you put all your money in Amazon stock a year ago, you would have doubled your money.

The general philosophy is with greater reward comes higher risk -- and vice versa.

"Credit union employee here, unfortunately see this all the time. Answering your questions in order:

1. No, the Mom is legally entitled to everything in the joint account. The bank won't refund a dime as technically nothing illegal happened.
2. Yes. Some folks in this thread have suggested leaving in whatever Mom may have deposited as a gesture of goodwill. You are not obligated to do this (has she even deposited at all?) but it would be a nice buffer against total family meltdown.
3. It might vary, but you will need a photo ID with a current address on it. Since you want to open an account with the same institution, they might not even need that (since they have all her information already verified to their satisfaction). Otherwise, two pieces of 'official' mail will do it- bills, bank statements, anything of the like.
4. You could, but I wouldn't recommend it. If Mom is a recognized 'regular customer' the tellers might slip up and give her information about the new account she is not entitled to. For safety's sake I'd go elsewhere. If your girlfriend really wants to stay with this branch, I'd suggest having her discuss the situation with the branch manager. Seriously, I know it sounds odd to lay out family drama on a strange businessperson, but they have heard this story a thousand times and will know how to handle it. At my institution we have a very simple system of alerts that we put on accounts- you'd simply say ""Can you put a note on my account that my mother is not to receive any info about it whatsoever?"" and that would be that.
5. Yep, no problem. Bring some proof of income, some banks require that on hand to open a checking (or even a savings). Of course, if your girlfriend shows up with a few thousand dollars (preferably in the form of a cashier's check) I'm sure they'll let her do whatever she likes.

"This would be a good reason to sit down with a financial planner and work out a plan. Ask your friends and family and see if they have anyone they would recommend.

Risk sounds a lot scarier than it really is. You don't want to invest $30,000 and then check on it and two weeks and only have $15,000. I totally get that. That's why any financial planner would recommend a diverse investment. 

This is going to be super simple with numbers, but it's a good guideline as to what you can expect. The numbers i'm using are for easy math. 

You could invest your money in groups of three.

Group A: $10,000 in stocks/mutual funds. These are the riskiest, but they also carry the greatest potential to make the big bucks.

Group B: $10,000 in bonds. You aren't going to get rich off of bonds, but you will make money and they are fairly sturdy. The odds of losing money is low.

Group C: $10,000 in cash equivalents (treasury bills, etc). You aren't going to make much money here, but your investment is solid. You won't be losing money either.

let's say you have a great year. Group A does really, really well and after 12 months, your portfolio looks like this:

Group A: $16,000

Group B: $13,500

Group C: $10,500

As you can see, the group with the stocks went crazy. You made a ton of money. Group B was pretty good. Group C was meh. At least you didn't lose any money. Now your financial planner (or you) should redistribute your funds. You have $40,000 in total assets, so divided by three, it looks like:

Group A: $13,333

Group B: $13,333

Group C: $13,334

Total: $40,000

Let's say in year 2 of your investment, the economy goes to shit and takes another dive. Uh oh, you are going to lose money - good thing you have a diverse portfolio!

Group A is full of stocks, so this gets hit the hardest. -$5,000 leaving $8,333 in the account. Ouch.

Group B is hit, but not as hard. -$2,000. That leaves $11,333.

Group C isn't hit at all. In fact, it makes the same amount of money as last year. +$666

The year was terrible. But you aren't hurt. Your portfolio looks like this:

Group A: $8,333

Group B: $11,333

Group C: $14,000

Total: $33,666

In fact, you still have more money than you started with, and since investments tend to MAKE money over the long haul (historically at least), you should always net out ahead. 

Here is what happens if you don't diversify your portfolio with the same gains that I just mentioned:

Year 1: $30,000 - invest into stocks and gain 60%

End of Year 1: $48,000

Market Crashes - lose 38% of stock value

End of Year 2: $30,000

In this scenario, you are right back where you started even after having a huge year 1. With a diverse portfolio, you lost money, but you still have more than you started with.

I want to make it clear that the gains and losses I listed are exaggerated, but in the interest of making the point in a 2 year window of investment, it makes sense.",null,null,null,Useful-ldiot,null,null,1446670504,t5_2qstm,t3_3riuje,t1_cwojg36,19,1449599905,0,0,cwol7yp,personalfinance,19,null,null

**First, prepare to deal with the emotions**
For many here on r/PF the future is wide open. We're paying attention to what we need to do to be safe in the future financially, and we have lots of time for those plans to pay off. Our runway to financial security is very long because we're mostly young. However,  the older you get the shorter that runway is and at some point the runway becomes SO short your plane can't take off. Imagine getting to an age when you can no longer count on your physical health to provide you the capabilities to support yourself? It's hard to imagine a more desperate feeling than believing it's too late for you to help yourself; the runway is all used up.

Your mom is going through that right now, and one of the key things you can do for her is help support her emotionally. Reassuring her that she's not a burden, but that instead she supported you without asking for anything to prepare you for a future in which you're able to take care of her, even if she didn't realize it. Now you can afford to help take care of her to repay her.

After you've worked to do some healing with her on the utter hopelessness she feels right now, you can shift the conversation to the world of possibilities still open to her. In many markets, simply being willing to work is all one needs to get a job. It may not be auspicious work, but if you can help her with her expenses (living and food), then she can focus on rebuilding her finances and getting her footing secure for the future. She has a background in sewing? Awesome, that's a skill! She should start scouting for jobs at Joann's Fabrics or Michael's, an area she has expertise in. Then, she can work on sewing projects for extra income on the side in her free time. If she feels guilty about living ""free"" at your place? Offer her a trade: she handles cooking, cleaning, and household chores, you handle yardwork and bills. Show her how much it would cost you to pay someone to do those things (a live-in maid/chef will run you $40-50k/year).

**Buying a MIL suite**
I live in a MIL suite right now, and I'm looking at buying with my wife in the next few years. We're only looking at homes with MIL suites to help care for parents if we need to in the future. It's financially a no brainer PROVIDED you are planning and willing to own a home in the first place. If that's the place you're at, then get the MIL. The reason is simple: in the short term, your mom can live there for much cheaper than you can afford to pay for her to live elsewhere. If you have kids in the future? Perfect, the best babysitter in the world lives in-home, saving you a BUNDLE on daycare. And when your mom stabilizes and decides she wants her own place to live? Boom, you have a room for rent in your home that pays for your mortgage. Plus, MIL suites increase the resale value of a home. It's a huge financial win.

One note: make sure the MIL suite has it's own entrance, or could relatively cheaply have it set off so it can have its own entrance. If you wind up in a position to rent the house, you (and the people renting) will want their own entrance.

**Prepare for your financial future**
The best thing you can do for yourself is prepare for your own financial future. Following r/pf is a start, and I recommend r/financialindependence as well. Get your debt paid down, get your emergency fund built up (you've got to save for two essentially), and make sure you're doing what you need to protect your future finances to avoid being in the position your mom is in. It also makes it so that she is taken care of because she doesn't have to worry about you, and when you have a dependent it's even more important your own financial house is in order (I felt a lot of pressure when my wife went back to school and I was the sole income in the house, but then we got our 6 months of expenses saved up and I felt a LOT better). Follow the tips in the sidebars here and check out r/FI too for tips on cutting bills, maximizing savings, and ensuring you get the most bang for your buck (your salary is good, so you should be in solid shape to prepare for your future).

**Encourage your mother to take care of her future**
The steps to financial independence come one at a time, and you don't resolve financial matters overnight. If you can support your mother through addressing her feelings of depression and worthlessness over relying on you financially, transition her to finding hope for the future and working out to make it on her own, then you can focus on helping her prepare for a future in which she's financially independent. If she's saving on food and housing while living with you, make sure she saves her money to prepare for her next steps. And MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T FEEL GUILTY ABOUT DOING THIS. She's going to try to give you money for how guilty she feels, but it's more important for both of you that she starts preparing for the future and saving those dollars. Saving them today means she'll have her own security in the future and won't need to rely on you, and that's far more important than whether she can chip in for groceries.

I'm just some guy on Reddit, so take this for what it's worth, but this isn't a hopeless situation. Your mom feels that way probably because of some depression and because it's just SCARY to be where she is, but like any financial disaster it's one step at a time until a few years from now you look back and think, ""Jeez, what were we so scared of?""

15 year mortgage running 5% on an $80,000 house is going to run $633 a month, almost exactly half of what he is talking about paying in rent. Pay the amount you would be paying for rent and pay the house off early. Nothing beats having personal ownership of the property you live on. 

After paying off that house, keep setting aside the same amount after paying off the house. In 10 years (factoring in a meager 2% interest) you will have accumulated $167,702.57.

"&gt; The second house I looked at had the in-law suite above the garage, which was detached, so that seems like a fine situation to be in considering the circumstances.

Just a reminder that while she can likely handle the stairs fine now, in 10 years that could easily not be the case. You're going to want something on the ground floor for her.

Have her check out etsy, I see little old ladies doing brisk business with their sewing on there. Also you might help her try making sewing videos/tutorials for youtube - if you have a smartphone you have what you need to get started. There's a lot of potential for earnings there.

"The best way to rent a car is ""make a reservation"" online, which just asks you for your name and email, for a cheap car- then when you go to the branch they'll try to upsell you a better car and once you say no they'll usually just give you the better car for same rate(if they don't have your reserved car at the moment).

"I'm going to disagree with the posters saying to get married ""on paper"" in 2015 for tax purposes.    $7000 is basically nothing when compared to the lifelong contract you are signing, and for most people $7000 would be a very substantial amount to save just based on getting married (probably substantial income difference between partners, and possibly educational tax credits for the low earning partner).

If you want to get married, you should do so, however such a small sum of money should not be your prerogative.  You are making a financial pact and partnership worth millions of dollars over the course of your lifetime, and you should only do so when you are ready to do so.  

Basically, my advice is to get married in 2015 if you want to, and if you want to get married in 2016, do that.  Do not think about it as getting married ""on paper"".  You will be married, full stop.  

If you want to save money, you should consider having a private ceremony this year (or next year), and foregoing a big reception.  In fact, your reception is likely going to be much more impactful of a financial decision than the tax savings of getting married one year sooner.

Is the interest rate predatory or decent?  If it's decent, the best thing to do is likely suck it up and keep paying.

If it is predatory, the best thing to do might be something like:

* purchase a CHEAP used car. Craigslist has lots of vehicles for less than $3000, many of which are probably fine.

* get a personal loan from a local credit union for $10K or so at, hopefully, a decent interest rate.

* sell the vehicle, use the proceeds from the sale plus the extra loan cash to pay off the lender

* pay off the credit union while driving the cheap used car

I assume for these purposes that a car is ""necessary"" and can't be worked around.  If it isn't necessary, a bus pass would be a good choice.

&gt; Howdy! I am a mortgage loan specialist for BoA. First off, when all banks look at giving you a loan, there are four pieces of criteria that all banks look at.

&gt; 1) Down payment

&gt; 2) Credit

&gt; 3) Debt to income

&gt; 4) Reserves (after purchase money)
&gt;   
&gt; First off, congrats. Buying a home is an awesome experience, and I hope whoever is guiding you through is sitting you down and explaining things to you.  
&gt;   
&gt; Second, our rule at BoA is that you can usually quadruple the amount of income a person makes in a given year, and that is what they are pre-qualified for, so $200,000 seems about right, honestly.  
&gt;   
&gt; Third, you will more than likely have a couple of hoops to jump through when dealing with credit. Since you don't have 3 trade lines of credit,  you'll more than likely have to have a freddie mac backed loan, which is fine, but, like I said, more hoops. Unconventional credit will raise the risk level, so you must provide a 2 year rent history (with your name on the lease, if you've been living with your parents, you are shit out of luck), and you will have the option to provide a couple of other pieces (I think you need 3 altogether) such as student loans in your name, electricity in your name or cable in your name, your car payment would work.  
&gt;   
&gt; Fourth, its bullshit if you cant get a credit card. Get one from your bank, but honestly, you should have gotten them a while ago. Seriously, just walk in and ask for a bank credit card, if I can issue one to a 16 year old, you can get one.

"Stop!  Your mother has made a whole lifetime of bad financial decisions.  You can give her every penny that you ever will make and she will never be in a good place.  She has no equity in the co-op.  She has a ton of credit card bills, medical bills, bankruptcy, and no savings.


Stop!  Quit talking to contractors &amp; realtors, who just want your money.  There is no benefit to spending $5,000 of your money, just so your mother can break even.  Wasting $130 a month to store her excess stuff, for her to break even, doesn't help.


You sound like you are in a good place, since you work as an RN.  I understand that you want to help your mother and appreciate that.  You can't give up all your security &amp; goals, just because other people don't manage their money.  I can speak from personal experience that I could go live in a cardboard box on the side of the road, and give all my money to my family to ""help them back on their feet"".  It wouldn't ever be enough.  Once you get involved in their finances and start giving money, you help their income but have no control of their expenses.   They still spend money or waste it.  You can't make someone shop cheaper or clip coupons.  You can't make someone not buy a hot tub that they won't ever use!  You can't make someone stop leasing a new car every 2 years.  You can make someone stop impulse buying stuff, or get rid of expensive cable package.  :)


At this point, your mother should work her problems out herself.  Frankly, she should just let the co-op naturally go to foreclosure &amp; eviction, if she can't pay the bill.  In meantime, start selling or giving all the extra furniture.  After foreclose, she should file bankruptcy.   Don't worry if she can't get a loan later.  Actually, that is good, since she can't keep digging a hole for herself.  Her credit is junk anyway.  If she is disabled, she should investigate disability pay and start looking for a new place to stay.


I honestly want you to do well and be less stressed out.  It is good to help your mother out, but you need to keep yourself protected.  At some point, you need to retire too!  I suggest that you limit your contribution to your mother, and stick firmly to it.  Decide ahead of time how much that you can afford to help out.  5% of your income?  10% of your income?  Instead of giving her cash to waste, offer to pay the electric bill and go grocery shopping for her.  


Good luck and please keep us updated.  If you need more examples from my family, I have plenty more!  :)

"That's about 53% of your earnings gone in taxes and deductions. Ouch.

I live in California and they ""only"" take 43% of my check after the disability insurance deduction is paid off in June (I don't have a medical insurance deduction either).

I'm assuming you're single and don't have any personal deductions, so it makes sense that your percentage would be higher than mine - but it shouldn't be 10% higher.

A few questions you might want to ask them on Monday - are they taking out a 401(k) or some other savings deduction?  Some kind of charitable deduction? Are there union dues or uniform costs or some other industry-specific deductions they might have taken?

Hope this is helpful and good luck!

when you do your taxes, whether or not you get the exemptions will be determined by your divorce and custody decree. if the decree is silent on the issue, IRS regs will dictate that the exemptions should be taken by the custodial parent. somebody else posted the link to the tool.

it is common for parents to trade exemptions annually -- you get them in taxes filed for even years, she gets them for taxes filed for odd years. however, do not attempt this unless your decree *actually* says this. if you have multiple children, sometimes the order is written so that each of you takes one (but make certain you do not both take the *same* one!).

my ex-wife and i do not have such a clause in our order; instead, i run my taxes both ways and then ask her if she wants a cut of the refund i would get, which would usually wind up being more money for her because her income is so poor. if she accepts, there's an IRS form she fills out for each child that gives me the right to claim them. with her signature on that form, i take the exemptions, and if she tries to claim them herself too, the IRS slaps her.

"EMS Helicopter pilot here. Yeah, the bill sucks and it's definitely sticker shock. Were/are you insured? If so the insurance will probably pick up some portion of the bill. If they don't cover all of it the EMS company will ""come after you"" for the rest of the bill.

"Just a dumb redneck here giving his two cents.... it may sound preachy.. but it's well intentioned. You sound a lot like me back about a decade or so. 

I've been a landlord for years (not currently one) and I never checked someone's credit score. It's a falsehood that you NEED to have a good credit score to get into apartments. Hell, rent a small house from decent landlords. The large 10 story big box apartment complexes aren't the only game in town. It may be harder to rent from a corporate apartment complex, so deal with the HUNDREDS of local landlords that can see you're a guy on the upswing and that you have been at your job for a year. Your paycheck should be good enough. IT may mean you spend a little more time looking for an apartment but don't play kissy face with the banks anymore than you have to. It's a rigged game. 

Also, start saving up money to get out of that lease. In pure ROI, leases cost the most to operate and own a vehicle. Save up some money and buy a used car cash. Then keep moving up in car every year or so, all the while still paying yourself that car payment. That way you have options.. and you're not stuck losing 30% of the Car's initial value within the first 3 - 5 years from the time you drive it off the lot. Cars are made to DRIVE a lot more miles on average than they used to, with a lot less 'average' mechanics fees. 

I don't think you need another credit card. Don't get any deeper into it with cc companies. It's not a popular thing to say, and I get slammed for it every time I post on here NOT TO GET INTO DEBT or use Credit CARDS. I say this because I want to offer you a different narrative about life that no one told me about. What is your overall goal? Is having a good credit score really going to get you a better home or Car? Or is it continuing like you have been to live within your means, save/invest and pay cash for the things you set out to get. Self insure against emergencies and ""the boogie man"" by keeping a large emergency fund. Want a house in the future without a credit score? Find a mortgage company that will do Manual Underwriting on a house. Basically, if you have a 0 credit score and paid your bills on time, it shows you're a good steward of your money. The banks will loan to you. 

I was TOLD MY ENTIRE LIFE that College debt was 'good debt.' That buying things on CCs was good because I was getting points. And that everyone is going to have a mortgage payment and a car payment so build it into your monthly budget and forget about it. Well, by listening to all my well meaning colleagues and friends, I found myself like most people, BROKE! Yes I had a good cash flow because I was working, but I was just barely ""makin' them payments."" It sounds like you're NOT anywhere like this. But I too had almost NO debt until I was 21 or 22. I lived within my means. Then something got sideways. College loans, rental houses, a car loan... all that stuff. I'm cutting those bills away, bit by bit. And I want to offer my story as a cautionary tale. You can be like the minority of Americans, and pay off your card each month and do things responsibly. However, the credit card companies are BANKING on the fact that you're just like most of us, and will over extend and will then start 'just makin' them payments."" Good luck and just be aware of what I mention. 

But I plan on paying off my card each month??? Let me tell you a story. 
I have a friend. He's 50yrs old. Owns his own very small trucking company on the East Coast. He makes 200K a year, most likely more because his wife's a teacher. Eitherway... he has one credit card. 7K dollar limit. It's paid off EVERY MONTH in 28 days so he never is late. He says none of the credit card companies want to give him a higher loan limit. Because they aren't making any money off him on interest, maybe 90 bucks a year on a yearly fee. So, he's a GREAT income maker... saver... but Credit Card companies tell him, he's a losing bet... because he just DOESN'T pay interest. And I'm sure his credit score isn't very high either. Because he doesn't play the game. Not me... I'm not so good at paying it off exactly each month. So I'm paying off my balances with a ""quickness"" and closing each account as I go. I closed one account ""my very first credit union credit card"" just last week. Closed and kicked that damn account to the curb. 

Then again.. I'm going to take a whole load of crap from people. I'm just some redneck... offering a stupid opinion to a stranger over the internet.

"No, I am stating that for someone who may not be able to directly afford a full on Health Care Plan may want to look into getting Whole Life or Term if just needed temporarily. Life insurance works best when you are young and income sensitive (as most college age people are). It is just an option for him if he wants to wait out to get a career that offers a health plan and then he will already be set for life insurance for the rest of his life and build up cash value.

I was suggesting an alternative for his specific scenario. He doesn't have a job that offers health insurance yet, so I was saying he should sign up for life maybe a one-hour paid premium (very affordable and that he can increase for better benefits later in life), and then he could add on some accidental or non-accidental riders, waiver of premium, and an A71000 policy which covers a lot if not all medical expenses.

"Back in July I wrote a super newb post (deleted since it didn't receive very much positive attention) about how I was really struggling with my food service job making at best $1,200/month. I was starving and frustrated and angry with my budget and didn't know how to produce more income. I was strongly considering sex work (I'm 19/F for reference). Since then, though, I took all of the advice I got from this sub.

I moved out of my 1BR into a 2BR with a roommate. Decreased my rent from $545 to $334 and halved all of my utilities.

I got an evening job as a waitress for an extra 20 hours per week on top of the 30-35 that my other job was maxing me out at. Upped my income to anywhere from $1,900 to $2,200 per month (serving tables is shaky income. I'd never trust it as my sole source)

I put money in my savings account!! A lot of it!! This is the first time ever I've had more than $75 in a savings account. I had $1,000 in that thing up until yesterday when I had to get my alternator in my car changed for $300. Formerly having this thrown on me would have sent me into a breakdown but it was ok! I actually had the money and didn't have to starve myself for it.

I paid every off little tiny bit of debt that I had. 
I haven't asked my father for money since JULY.

Guys, I'm not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. I'm living decently below my means for someone my age. I'm adulting so hard. Sometimes when I get my paychecks from my jobs I just put them in a drawer because I don't need them and forget about them until I have a nice stack of them and then I deposit them all at once and it's sooo satisfying to see it all go in at the same time... and then pay a few bills on time and throw another nice chunk of it into savings.

"This isn't a casual case of identity theft. Most of that shit they move on once the victim starts correcting it because it becomes too risky for them getting caught. 

In my eyes this is a very personal attack someone is making against you:

1) A very close ""friend"" or family member that feels they have been wronged. 

2) Someone in building management that doesn't like you. 

3) Someone in the post office that doesn't like you. 

4) I only include this for ""completeness"": Another personality in your head. 

Advice on going forward:

0) Insist on the police report contain EVERYTHING that's happened. I don't care how useless they think it is. A number of the potential ""crimes"" they committed are outside of the jurisdiction of them anyway. 

1) Move to PO Box.
 
2) Pay very close attention to the ""last logged in"" times on anything that you can. 

3) Consider checking your computer for a keylogger. 

4) Make sure a fraud alert is set (until you can get the freezes implemented). This will at least slow them down a teeny bit. 

5) Setup two factor authentication anywhere that allows it. 

6) Change account password on your cell phone (so they can't get around the two factor)

7) Reach out to executive customer service at the credit bureaus to get the freezes implemented.

"This is false.  No fault states do not make declarations that no one is at fault, instead they allow you to recover your damages from your own insurance policy, regardless of fault.  From there, if you are not at fault and the other driver is, your insurance company will subrogate from the at fault parties policy to collect the damages they paid.  

No fault insurance is designed to reduce the number of lawsuits related to accidents.  It is often linked with limited tort laws to further reduce the load on the legal system.  

Personally, I think we are going to see a change in our insurance policies that all states will go to no fault.  With self driving cars, it will make the most sense.  The insurance companies will still be able to pursue the at fault party for the damages caused but the insured party will be covered under their policy regardless of fault.  This means your policy will pay for any medical bills and repairs to your vehicle.  As it will no longer be clear who is at fault initially (right now we can reasonably say one of the drivers is at fault in nearly every accident), an investigation will be conducted and then your insurance company will pursue the at fault party to recover the losses.

The summary at the top of your resume should be a short, few, COMPLETE sentences that highlight the best, most marketable skills you own.  Write the summary for a human being to read.  Don't use bullet point lists, etc.  The keyword engines that prescreen resumes will find all of the words in your resume that match the intended filters, but the human that culls the final stack of resumes will never read that far down; these HR admins suffer from 'death by bullet point', don't know what technical terms really mean, have some arbitrary number of finalists to determine (like a maximum of 5 resumes to send to the hiring manager), and will not bother with a piece of paper after the seeing the first misspelling or bad sentence structure or such.

Then, break your 22 years into your favorite projects, the ones you'd love to talk about during an interview.  Chronological order may or may not be appropriate, depending on the flow of the projects.  Find a way to visually tie the projects together, like 

""Project abc:  Problem was this.  I solved it with that. Result was wow.""

Don't try to tell the whole story of the project.  Save the reasons for why you solved the problem in an unusual way for the interview.  22 years is worth 2 or 3 pages of resume.  Don't worry about the arbitrary rules like ""it must be one page or you'll trigger the zombie apocalypse!""

Any practice you can do before the phone interview will be beneficial; books of interview questions and answers in your field; buy a recruiter lunch in exchange for giving you a thorough phone-style interview (could be over lunch with her just reading through your resume and asking questions).

The company's purpose for the face interview is to see if you are ""one of us"".  This is also true for you, but since you're out of work, it's not at the top of your list.  Rehearse interviewing with different people, even children.  Take all of their questions seriously and answer them thoughtfully.  The questions are not designed only to test your knowledge (what is microscope xyz really good for?) but to evaluate your interactions with potential coworkers, the human fit being the most important.

You have something that many younger candidates won't have demonstrated:  staying power.  Be sure you have a good brief story that sells your reasons for 22 years at the same company in a positive, easily understood way; i.e. ""we loved the school system where we lived, my job kept getting more interesting every year, and my manager was wonderful to work with.  There were ups and downs like everywhere else, but we overcame them all until now"".

"I generally agree with much of your comments, however I have always had better luck with manual transmission vehicles. Manuals give you lots of warning before something goes wrong, autos do not. I make make a fair bit of side cash by buying hondas and toyotas with blown auto transmissions, fixing, painting and reselling. Your point about not using the overdrive too much makes no sense. Only time it's worth shutting the od off is when towing a trailer if you find your transmission is consistently hunting in/out of overdrive. Also, trucks are built heavier duty than cars. Most cars with 200k on them are used up junk. I wouldn't buy a car with over 120k or so. Trucks on the other hand can have a lot of life left in them. My diesel 3/4 ton pickup has 340k miles on it, and thr first big repair has come up - a blown transfer case. I've never heard of a $1200 ball joint.

though im really a volvo guy, subarus are good cars. stay the fuck away from the 2.5 motor on pre-2000 outbacks/legacys. i had a 98 that blew the HG a 2nd time (first was by original owner who replaced HG with a stock one((DO NOT DO THIS!)) and the block as well) because the idiot previous owner replaced the HG with an OEM one, which is the only real problem. the material the OEM is made out of corrodes when it comes into contact with coolant.

OP:

you want an 89 - 93 legacy or a 91-95? volvo 850 series. t5 = awd. you can also shoot for a v70, pre-2000. 

the v70 might be a hair out of your price range, but the volvo 850 and subaru legacy are both within your price range, are super reliable, parts are abundant and cheap and working on them is really easy. id go for the subaru, but make sure you find one with AWD. not all models are AWD but most are.",null,null,null,jerkiusmaximus2,null,null,1448325119,t5_2qstm,t3_3tzpix,t1_cxasj8t,21,1449983315,0,0,cxassf0,personalfinance,21,null,null

And that is worth more than loving my job right now.  

**Loving or even liking your job is a luxury for those who can afford it.**

At $36.5 even with no real expenses OP is going to be crushed under this debt for years. This is $112,209 at a weighted average of about %7 interest. This isn't a debt to income ratio where you just live with your parents for a couple years. This is crushing debt where you live OFF your parents into your thirties, or you leverage your skill set and make more money, period. 

/u/heitzzzzz, do you want to date, move out, save for retirement, get married, get a new car, have kids, or buy a house in the next decade? Maybe? Then get more money, from a part time job, from job hopping, or whatever. Whatever you like about your job and current income won't really hold up over time if you can never move forward with the life you want to live outside of work. 

By contrast, if you go get the money you can make, you could easily get to $100K in 5 years by applying yourself and focusing on your strengths in computers. There are a ton of jobs and junior dev positions all over the country and they are a lot different from school. I guarantee you don't know what it's really like to be a dev if you've never been a dev. School for CS is exhausting at best and feels worthless at worst but the money is out there. 

Loan forgiveness takes a long time. A LONG time where you could miss a payment or get a job offer and miss out on it. It's not a good strategy when you have so much earning potential.

"Right so let's ""move goal posts back"" and examine each word:

Like, you know, ""able"" to be ""intelligent"".  This word is about as complicated as words like ""capable"", and ""compressible"".  This isn't rocket surgery.

&gt; ""Formulae""

Like you know, the plural form of formula.  We've established that ""formula"" is a 6th grade term.

&gt; ""Exponential""

We have established this is a 7th grade term.

&gt; ""plot""

Like plotting a picture.  Plotting an evil plan.  ""TO PUT SHIT ON PAPER"".  This is also taught alongside algebra in 7th grade to be synonymous with ""Graph"".  ""Plot the equation X=Y"" is a very common question in math.

&gt; ""Decimate""

This one's tricky.  I actually used to use it incorrectly myself.  It means to reduce by 1/10th.  The common (mis)understanding is that it is much more catastrophic and synonymous with words like ""annihilate"" and ""exterminate"".  Still, in the context given, the word can be interpreted correctly OR incorrectly and the meaning of the sentence is more or less preserved.

Third, if there are still people who do not learn from classic established systems, and who choose to not educate themselves, then there are still online calculators that will literally spell it out for you.

Finally, if someone chooses to not even use these online calculators, then I have no pity.  Increased financial education will never ""fix"" the problem of people who do not take the time or effort to learn.

"STAY AWAY FROM MUTUAL FUNDS. THEY ARE FOR LAZY PEOPLE.
Learn how to invest and do it yourself.

Anything with increased earnings growth in the past 3-4 QUARTERS.

Mutual funds are extremely dodgy. They are for lazy people who don't want to take the time to learn how to do it themselves and pay someone to do it for them. The worst part about them is that even if there is a negative return, such as -5% you will stay pay the 1.5% management fee for a grand return of -6.5%. See the problem?

Why would you pay someone 1.5% on an investment that will yield 7%. That leaves you with 5.5% which is absolute shit. If you are paying someone 1.5% in fees, you better be seeing a return of 20%+ (my personal opinion)

PLEASE DON'T BE LAZY AND LET SOMEONE DO IT FOR YOU, TEACH YOURSELF TO DO IT.

Here is some math
Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years at 7% return = $30,957.48
Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years at 5.5% return = $23,342.06
You just paid someone $7615.42 because you were too lazy to learn how to do it.

MORE MATH
Invest 8000 for 20 years at 10%,15%,20%,25% ROI (return on investment)
10% = $53,819.99
15% = $130,932.29
20% = $306,700.79
25% = $693,889.39

Invest $8,000.00 for 20 years while contributing 100$ monthly or $1200 annually
10% =$80,684.31
15% =$253,864.59
20% =$530,726.39
25% =$1,105,423.02
Now obviously averaging a return between 10-25% over a 20 year period is difficult to do. But it is not unheard of.
You see those numbers? THAT IS ONLY WITH $8000 DOLLARS. IMAGINE IF YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT OVER A 50 YEAR PERIOD WITH MORE MONEY. 

Invest $50,000 for 50 years at same ROI
10% =$5,869,542.64 =  You can literally live off of the interest in a 1.5% savings account now. One years worth of interest will equal $89,363.79 DOLLARS FOR DOING NOTHING
15% =$54,182,872.08 = Oh sure ill take a picture for top 1000 wealthiest people in the state
20% =$455,021,907.5 = Forbes wealthiest people? Sure why not
25% =$3,503,246,161 = Great, just joined the billionaire club. Maybe Ill buy a city for luls.

inflation rises above interest rates all the time and even if it is below the interest rate it is subtracting from your interest. So you are getting tiny tiny returns on interest.

Unlike other financial advisors, they charge way less and provide additional value like goal-based planning advice, tax advice, automatic tax loss harvesting, automatic portfolio rebalancing, and slick apps. They choose low expense ratio funds from Vanguard, iShares, and Schwab so you don't have to decide which ones are good purchases and can diversify beyond just what Vanguard offers.

Uniform Transfers to Minors Account (UTMA) is one vehicle where it's legally in your sister's name (i.e., she owns it), but you could be listed as the custodian on the account (i.e., you're in control of it until she turns 18 or 21, depending on your state and the terms of the account when it's set up).  Income and, eventually, appreciation gains are taxable to your sister.  Funds can be used for anything.

College 529 plans are another vehicle where you actually own the account, but list her as a beneficiary (e.g., she has neither a legal interest nor control).  Interest and appreciation gains accumulate income-tax free in the account (and you may get an income tax deduction for your yearly contributions).  Funds can only be used for ""qualified educational expenses"" without incurring a tax penalty.

Keep in mind that some of these approaches may be more or less effective or beneficial with respect to her eligibility for need-based financial aid.

"well in terms of catching the criminals, if wired to a account in Florida, should be easy to find. Digital money always leaves a trace. Plus, if you report it ASAP, the person will have a harder time converting it into cash. He cant just walk into a bank and ask for 100k in hundreds. I mean if its a smaller amount maybe a couple thousand, than the criminal couldve dispersed those funds already, but a 100 grand? Theyre gonna need some time to move it around and change it into liquid cash. 

But if they wired the cash into a Florida account, and than right away wired the funds out into another bank account internationally...... 

But in terms of getting the money back? The banks or the governments do not insure these funds. When she wired it out she signed a document releasing the bank of any liabilities as the bank cannot verify the 3rd party receiving it on the other end. In the wire transfer papers the bank made your grandmother sign, it states she is willingly giving the funds to X person or business, through this financial institution. 

Although the banking laws and regulations may differ from state to state, it does not hurt to go into a bank and see what they can do on their end. 

Another sneaky sneaky way to go about it is, ask the bank for all necessary documents regarding the wire transfer. See if they forgot to ask your grandmother for a signature here or their in the documents. If they did, the wire is no longer valid as your grandmother did not authorize it and they have no proof via no signature. But this is going a whole another direction. But just saying, its a FYI. Ive seen it work for clients working at the bank, a newer staff member attempted to do something, papers printed out that needed signatures or documentation, but they missed a line that asked the client to sign.

"Ok, bank fraud investigator here. What your grandma has experienced is extremely common, especially with the elderly. Wires are the bane of our existence since they are essentially instantaneous and can be hard to recover. However, it is possible to mitigate some of the damage if we're notified immediately.

First: get in touch with her bank's fraud department. Do it yesterday. You don't give any timelines here, so I don't know how long it's been since she sent the wire(s), but there's a tiny chance that the funds can at least be partially recovered if it's been a day or two since the wire was sent. Your bank's fraud department will probably try to work directly with the fraud department at the other bank and see if any of the funds can be recovered. No bank wants to be involved in fraud, so it's a mutually beneficial arrangement if they can send some of the funds back (if there are any left). 

Next, have her file a complaint with the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/). Also file a complaint with the [Internet Crime Complaint Center](http://www.ic3.gov/).

Then try filing a police report again, although you're right in that it won't do much good. Still important to get it on the record if possible.

Finally, make sure that she didn't give out any of her private information to the scammers: account numbers, SSN, anything like that. If she did, her account information and/or identity is compromised, which is a huge risk. 

Also, your uncle is probably wrong about the identity of the scammer. No scammer of this caliber is dumb enough to use their actual phone number, and in fact, the phone numbers are usually spoofed to look like legit financial institution numbers in order to add another layer of ""legitimacy."" It's probably a scam ring located out of the country, as 99% of them usually are.

It sounds like it's high time for someone else to have authority over Grandma's accounts. She unfortunately cannot manage her funds anymore.

Edit: One other thing I thought of. She is going to be ridiculously embarrassed. Be gentle to her and try to reassure her that she is *not* the only one. Hundreds of thousands of people fall for these, including doctors and lawyers. AARP has [some good resources](http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/) about scams, that are targeted to seniors. Here's a great article of theirs on [lottery scams](http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-10-2013/tips-to-avoiding-lottery-scams.html), one of the most common that the elderly fall for. Many local AARP groups have seminars about it, too. My boss goes every few months to do presentations for local retirement homes. You might be able to find something like this for your grandma. They also have support groups for scam victims, although I'm not sure how you'd find one. Maybe check with some local retirement homes or an AARP chapter.

Edit3: Sorry, comments are locked so I can't reply to the rest of you. If anyone still wants a question answered feel free to PM me. :) I'd like to leave with a reminder that it's easy to laugh at people who fall for these (and I'm definitely guilty of rolling my eyes a lot) but remember that these scammers are incredibly experienced at manipulating people. A couple years ago I found myself in the position of an in-person scam (I was looking at a Craigslist rental and the guy was all kinds of shady, the apartment was sketchy, he didn't have a lease, etc). It was incredibly hard to stay objective and get out of the situation even though all my instincts told me something wasn't right. The guy was good. He was a smooth talker, he complimented me, lamented the fact that I ""didn't trust him, and that wasn't fair"", blah blah. He even insinuated that my boyfriend was abusive (because he had vocally expressed his suspicions) and I needed to leave him and make my own decisions.

I understand how liberal or free-spirited Reddit can be, but that is honestly terrible and incredibly irresponsible ""personal-finance"" advice. You used an empirical situation to justify a 22 year-old spending $9,000 (which could be spent on reasonable real-estate projects like he inquired about, especially given his father's field) traveling to Amsterdam. 

Sure, you know some cherry-picked people who followed that plan and probably ""found themselves,"" and that's great for them. However, suggesting that to a 22 year old with $9,000 in the bank, a girl he wants to marry, and an apparently promising future?? I know people who blew through their money in similar endeavors, and gained absolutely nothing from it. You know what we call it when someone spends all of their money traveling to Amsterdam? A binge, generally.

This sub is supposed to be about legitimate financial advice, not ""Wow! You've saved up a respectable amount of money and apparently made wise decisions very early in life! Time to drop everything you've done so far and explore Europe ;)""

Retirement is lower per month than it normally should be because I started hitting the 401k pretty hard around age 25 and we can afford to coast a bit now with 20-25 years to go, so we've backed off a bit to put in college money.

Edit: I question my own comment below. It's from memory and things have likely changed...

Isn't it a tax credit, and not a deduction? That is, if you pay $2000 in interest, your taxes owed decrease by $2000. A deduction would only lower your taxable income by $2000, and the taxes owed would decrease by $2000 * your tax rate. At least, that's how it was when I had student loans.

"Man, these people are such scum.  About 6 years ago I got a call from my Grandma and Grandpa:

Grandma: ""Hello! Did you get the money we sent you?""
Me: ""No, you sent me money? I can go check the mail."" (Odd because my grandparents lived 2 miles away and we had dinner every Sunday).
Grandma: ""Ok, are you ok? Do you need anything else?""
I am starting to get suspicious, this is weird.
Me: ""Yea....I am fine Grandma, just a regular work day""
Grandma: ""Did you get out of jail?""
My brain has kicked into alert mode
Me: ""Grandma, what are you talking about?  I've never been in jail"".
Grandma: ""You called this morning, you were arrested in Canada and needed $7,300 for bail"".
Oh god, I live in Maryland, why on earth would I be in Canada during a work week?
Me: ""Grandma, listen, I am fine, I am not in Canada, I have not been in Canada for over a year.  What did you do with the $7,300?""
Grandma: ""Grandpa just got back from Wal-mart and used western union to send it to you in Canada.  Are you not in Canada?""
Me: ""Grandma, stay where you are, I am calling Dad (my father, there son).  I think you have been scammed, I was not arrested, I am perfectly safe and sound in Maryland.  When I hang up, wait for a call from Dad, have Grandpa ready to go to Walmart, you're gonna need to cancel the wire transfer.  Love you"". /hangsup

I call my Dad, explain the hullabaloo of what has happened.  My dad lives 2 miles in the other direction and was off work at this point.  So he was able to rush over, get my Grandpa, go to Walmart and very very luckily cancel the transfer.  It had not been picked up on the other end yet.  And even further, they were able to detain the person on the other for fraud.

Essentially, this person called my grandparents pretending to be me, saying I was in jail in Canada and needed bail money and to wire it right away.  My Grandma says for the life of her that the person calling sounded exactly like me.  

I cannot understand how my grandparents didn't think to call my parents, who live no further than I do and collaborate about me being arrested in Canada.  But no, they just did what 80 year old people can do in that situation.  My grandparents are smart people, my grandfather built Japan's first nuclear reactor when he worked for GE.  But someone sounded like me over the phone and they just sent money.  

These scumbags typically don't get caught, we were extremely lucky.  I sincerely hope you are able to reclaim some, if not all of the money.  It is really a heartbreaking scenario.  The top commenter is absolutely right, I know my first instinct was to be annoyed my grandparents did something so blatantly stupid, but I stepped back and realized that these scumbags preyed on them and they are the victims, and not to victim blame.  They made a mistake out of pretty darn generous kindness.

Good luck!

"First, both of you need to get and/or maintain a job and work as much as possible, looking for promotion opportunities at every turn.  I've known many successful people who made it simply by doing this.  
Next, use *reliable* birth control until you are 100% ready to be in a committed relationship and raise children.  
Third, cook food yourself.  The savings from avoiding pre-cooked/pre-packaged foods is extraordinary, and it's healthier for you.  If you don't know how to cook, get a book at the library.  
Fourth, save your money up and buy quality whenever possible.  This is a LOT harder than it sounds, and a key driver to wealth.  You actually might want to **avoid** WalMart/Dollar Stores, because low price often means low quality.  Price does NOT equal value, and you may spend more replacing crappy (new) things than going to a thrift store or yard sale and buying quality that lasts.  WalMart prices for raw food are often higher than local produce markets, and they use pre-packaged as loss leaders (but it's still more expensive than cooking for yourself and less healthy).  
Next, consider renting a room (as a couple) in someone's house, rather than taking on the full burden of rent and utilities.  It's very possible you could find an older person who would love to have some help around the house and let you live very inexpensively.  
Next, volunteer.  Yup, in addition to working your butt off, spend a few hours (as a couple) every week doing something to give back.  It will provide extraordinary perspective and keep you from feeling sorry for yourself.   
Finally, if you're going to be 'grown up', then *do it*.  Ditch the video games and bullshit your friends are all (likely) doing.  It **will** suck for a few years, but then you'll be enjoying the 'real' world and on a great path while they're figuring out basics.

Money is a tool used to drive out people that don't want to live among another set of people, in a sense you can look at it as a pre-qualifier. 

Riverside is also very cheap, especially compared to LA or SF. 

You can find out how to sublease or perhaps find your own place by going to the local craigslist, hotpads, domo or even airbnb for monthly/long term stays. Negotiation is everything. 

But yes, 30% of your income is slotted to be used for living expenses, this means your take home monthly should be $2400, to afford at $800. This is completely normal-- for some people depending on income this can be dropped down to 25-20% because they make much more gross.

You're not alone though, it is a hugely debated issue of how living expenses are nearing or bypassing 50% of an workers paycheck, as noted here:

http://www.kiplinger.com/article/spending/T050-C006-S001-cost-of-living-reality-check.html

(There was a great article in either the LA times or WSJ about young adults and living expenses that exceed 50%---can't find it.)

"The first bullet point is not a deductible, that is a limit. Insurance will pay a certain limit on some services for the year, and will stop after the threshold is reached.  However, using the same principle, a deductible is what you pay per visit. So if your session is 100 an hour, and Blue Cross is requiring you to pay 20 copay, that means they will cover the rest after your copay. 

The necessary forms your doctor is speaking of might be that since your doctor is not covered under the blue cross plan, the forms will assist in getting blue cross to cover the 'treatment' anyways. The medication is a separate deductible. I do not believe medication has a limit, but they do have a deductible per type of medication.

"I recently wrote a post in /r/dogs about [the cost of vet care for my dog over one year.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/3ozz98/discussion_costing_out_vet_care_the_dollar/) 

Month-to-month a dog doesn't cost terribly much-- it's just the potential for emergency that drives the cost up. $1500 in savings is not a bad nest egg but vet care can be extremely pricey and it's important to have a contingency plan. 

There's also the question of breed. A lot of people like large dogs but large dogs have a unique set of health problems which can be catastrophically expensive, namely bloat, which can kill in a matter of hours and requires rather expensive surgery. While the selection of any dog should be done based on your lifestyle, the cost of care is a factor that many people don't consider.

Dog start-up costs will probably run a few hundred dollars, and then there's the cost of the dog itself (even rescues will have a fee associated with them.) You might consider saving for a few more months to have a little more of a cushion in case Fido decides to eat a sock upon arrival in your new home and needs emergency surgery.

"Aside from trying to earn extra income (which you should definitely do on a regional pilot's salary), I would strongly recommend that you break out the old Private, Instrument, and Commercial oral exam guides by ASA and read through those. 
A pilot who goes by ""Demo"" told me that every pilot should put aside 45-60 minutes a day studying a certain system of their aircraft, or an aircraft in your company's fleet. 
You should also write out each of your emergency procedures (from memory) every day. You should chair-fly these procedures as well. 
You should chair fly for about an hour each day. If you know where you are flying, you should brief that flight completely and chair fly it. If you have any doubt what the arrival or departure procedures are for your arrival and destination, you should go over them. 

You said that this job is a stepping stone. The way to get into the majors is to know your information front and back. If you dare to forget one piece of that information (especially in the Instrument oral exam guide), the interviewer will find it and exploit it. 
If you want that shiny new job at FedEx or Delta, you have to know more than the interviewer. And like I said, the more you know about the planes you want to fly, the better.
If you get tired of going over what you already know, try staying at your airport and networking. There are plenty of pilots there whom you can learn from, and who can put in a good word for you. Keep business cards on you always, and never go back home without giving a few away. 

TL;DR: Spend your time being the best you can be in your current career instead of trying to become a ""Jack of all trades.""

If you have the cash in the bank then I would go to the bank and set up a savings account, even if you get 1% interest and put the cash in that account. Take out the loan at 2.7%, MAKE SURE IT IS A FIXED INTEREST if it is a variable interest loan next year the rate could be 17%. Have the loan payments come out of the savings account that would mean the cost of borrowing at 1% interest savings and 2.7% interest financing would cost you 1.7% which is pretty much nothing.

"The HOA that I was in before is a big reason why they haven't recovered from the housing bust. When your HOA dues go up year after year for little purpose except to keep paying a lawyer that is suing the builders specifically for two buildings out of about 10 in the community, your HOA dues will go up 10x+ (also because it's likely a financially mismanaged HOA if it's too low, too). Even if you had a miracle happen and the builders settle out of court like what happened in my situation, it takes years to get those funds back due to corporate lawyers being just that good (ever see that episode of Mr. Robot where the ex-CTO explain the legal defense strategy? Yeah, that's what I mean).

I wish I could say this is an unusual, terrible case, but there are many, many other HOAs that sued their builders and lost and are saddled with both high repair costs and lawyer bills that will take decades to pay off. This kind of HOA situation will suppress property value growth long term throughout the lifetime of your mortgage and there are many HOAs out there like that already, and one problem is that with an HOA you don't know if you might wind up in that situation in the future.

In some areas I've found it's really hard to find properties without HOAs such as in Las Vegas (seriously, why are 50%+ of houses built in the past 30 years stuck with HOAs there?) it can keep you from even considering buying a home.",null,null,null,djk29a_,null,null,1447906623,t5_2qstm,t3_3tc3sg,t1_cx5c89d,129,1449889701,0,0,cx5dguy,personalfinance,129,null,null

Your goals might very well change.  Everyone I knew at your age had a plan.  No one stuck to them.  Except the one guy who now runs a huge company in Singapore.  There's always one guy like that.

Point is:  be flexible in your thinking.  You're young.

&gt; How do I get started making this dream a reality

Spend less than you make.  Always.

Start putting money into your 401k immediately.  The money you put in now will have 3 or 4 decades to appreciate.  Make a spreadsheet and look at the future value of that money if it appreciates only a little but over inflation.

"I used to live in a neighborhood with an HOA. I used to think this way as well. Granted, my HOA fees weren't too atrocious, but they did come around and leave annoying messages on my door every now and then. I was in my late 20's and living in a suburb-y area, so everyone around me was much older. I didn't mow my lawn for about a month once and got a note. I also left a 79 F-350 in the street in front of my house for a month or two because I couldn't get it started.

The smart-ass notes they left me appeared to be authored by a 60-yr old widow with nothing better to do. I remember thinking, ""I'll show these fools whose boss!""

The seriousness of the notes began to escalate every few days if I didn't do anything about the issue. In retrospect, I probably should have just not been a punk and cleaned up the shiz in front of my house.

I have now moved to a much smaller house closer to work but in an area that doesn't have an HOA. About 75% of the houses are nice and tidy historic houses.

Let's assume that a self-directed portfolio of low-cost index fund would yield 6% per year over the long run. The advisor's additional 2.5 **percentage points** would bring my annual yield to 8.5%, which is **42% higher** than my original yield (8.5/6 - 1 = 42%).

"Hi, bank fraud investigator here. Sounds like you are on the right track. Your best bet is to go into the bank first thing in the morning and see if they can try to recall the wire. It's technically possible to recall one if the funds haven't been spent on the other end, but time is of the essence. 

Unfortunately you might have to learn a $2100 lesson. The check they gave you is fraudulent and it will be returned, meaning your bank will deduct the amount of the check from your account. This will likely mean you will be overdrawn and owe your bank that money. Make sure to be honest with them about what happened and they may be able to work with you about paying it back. That totally depends on the bank, though. Most larger banks will just send you to collections right away after your account has been overdrawn for x amount of days.

Please file a complaint with the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/) and the [Internet Crime Complaint Center](http://www.ic3.gov/). Also check your state's Attorney General site as they often have resources to report these types of things as well. And we always recommend filing a police report.

Finally, read up on the FTC's [scam page](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/scam-alerts) and familiarize yourself with the common characteristics of scams so you aren't victimized again.

Quick edit: the error bill isn't that surprising, if that helps. So, at least the hospital isn't the jersey here, it's definitely your insurance. 

Edit again: ah, I see, Travel Insurance. Yeah, I bet your boned on it. 

Still give the insurance company a call and see what they advise. Ask about getting paperwork filled out retroactively or something. 

If that fails and your on the hook for full patient responsibility, call up the hospital, ask to speak with their billing office, explain the situation and explain you would be paying out of pocket. 

Hospitals typically bill high to cover the uninsured and people who outright never pay. If they know a fortune 15 health care company isn't going to be covering an emergency room visit at 100% and it's all on the little guy, they can likely reduce the bill to be a bit more sane. Probably not as sane as you'd like, but not catastrophic either. Especially for an outpatient er visit and some labs all on a facility bill.

"First, make a full budget. A bull budget has a listing of all of your income, debt (with total amount owed, interest rates, and minimum payments), and expenses. ALL of your expenses. Without a budget, you won't be able to make a plan of attack since you don't know how much you have to work with.

I added up all the expenses you listed and I came up with $2,000. You didn't include debt minimum payments, so I know the actual amount is more. You make $2,400/month. Obviously, you don't have a lot of what you would classify as extra money to put towards that massive amount of debt.

So let's start making a plan for you. First, of course, is that budget. Make sure you actually know what you spend. Go through at least your last 3 months worth of credit card statements and categorize every single expense. You want to know if take out is really $150/month like you estimate or if it is more like $400/month. You won't know that until you start tracking your spending.

Sell the bike. You don't need it and you don't have the money for it.

Please realize that you have negative money. Lots and lots of negative money. Until you come to that realization, then spending money on things just because they mean a lot to you or it makes things more convenient will make sense. But it doesn't. Because you don't actually have the money to decide to spend to make life more convenient.

That means no more eating out. You don't go to a restaurant or a take out place until you once again have money. You cannot afford to hire a personal chef to make your meals when you are in credit card debt.

This is going to take a change in your thinking. Stop seeing your debt as another monthly payment and start seeing it as an [emergency](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/18/news-flash-your-debt-is-an-emergency/).

"&gt; People love using the ""dont want to break down on the side of the road"" excuse to justify buying a brand new car. 

no one needs an ""excuse"" to buy a new car if they want one. not wanting to break down is just one of many factors that go into the decision.

5 years ago i spent about 6 months looking for a good used car in the NYC area. what i got was lied to constantly. ""car was never smoked in!"" - meanwhile it reeks of smoke. ""i change the oil religiously"" - and yet the oil looks like molasses (viscosity- not color) and they don't have any paperwork to back it up. ""car is in great shape!"" - except for the front end needing an alignment, the bald tires, and the dents and dings all over the place.

eventually i said ""fuck it"" and bought a new car. i waited for the end of the quarter and the end of the model year and then called the Internet sales department at several places and gave them the specs i wanted. pretty much every quote i got back was well below tissue and i ended up getting an incredibly good deal (including most of the holdback and a bunch of extras thrown in). i could have paid cash for the car but the financing rate was so low it would have been silly to take my money out of the market to buy the car.

if i was going to sell the car a year or two later- then yes- it still would have been a stupid purchase. but since i plan to drive it until it can't be driven any further- and seeing as i take care of my ""shiny things"" - that will probably be a long way off.

was not wanting to break down a factor in my decision? sure- i routinely drive from northern NJ to Florida and knowing that i am driving a reliable and well cared for car makes that drive a lot less stressful. was it the only factor? not by a long shot. i bought an inexpensive car, have lots of disposable income, a well paying and stable job, ample emergency fund, and i take care of my stuff.

&gt; I guess that 'peace of mind' must be worth the extra 10k+ and associated financial bondage

the only way my new car could have cost an extra $10k would be if i bought a complete and total shitbox- at least based on the cars i saw for sale when i was looking. my new car was only about $5k more than a similar style 3-4 year old car- and most of those weren't in the greatest shape.

factoring all of that in, and amortizing the depreciation over what i hope will be a very long life, a new car made sense for me. is it right for everybody or every situation? of course not- but that's why you consider all of the factors.",null,null,null,[deleted],null,null,1446688982,t5_2qstm,t3_3rj1bu,t1_cwos3u1,134,1449605544,0,0,cwox1mr,personalfinance,134,null,null

"If I were you, I would 

1.Get rid of the mini and get a 4 door beater ASAP.

2.Budget $3000 for your total monthly expense.

3.Pay off all your credit cards first   

4.Tackle your student loans

If you can live on $3000/m for 2 years, you will pay off all your debts.

Does the new credit card offer lower interest?  If not, do not bother.   

Edit 1:  Having seen your budget, I think you need to tighten your belt in the following areas to obliterate your debts, in addition to the ones I mentioned above. 

1: Cancel your cable.  I bought a nice antenna($60) on Amazon and have Netflix.  My kids enjoy them greatly.  

2: Eat out once a month at most.  We do it once every 3 months. 

3: 0 Fast food.   It is just not healthy.

4: Cancel the gym membership. Pounding the pavement for exercise is nice.

5: Switch to Republic Wireless/Ting/Google FI.My Wife has RW, $12/m and I have Google FI, $23/m(I try not to use any data unless I am  on WIFI). I do not understand why people have to use so much cell data every month.  This is a matter of self-discipline/control.

6.When my kids were infants, we bought store brand diapers.  They worked great.   As for  formula, we did go for the best.  But it was around $200/m for our son.  My son is 2 now.  He is off  formula, but still very happy with his store brand diapers.

Both my wife and I drive a 10 year old well maintained car.  I do all the maintenance work(Motor Oil/Transmission Oil/Coolant changes, brake fluid flush and all minor repairs).  They will run for at least 10 more years.  So I would like to stress that you **get rid of the MINI**, get a beater for 2-3k off Craigslist and learn how to do some minor work on cars. It is easy and very useful since you will be able to take care of 2 cars in the future. It is well worth it.   Yes, i know i know the Mini is under water but it is sunken cost.  You are just treating the symptoms by trying to refi the Mini. 

Our total annual expenses for 2015 is about $43,000 for a family of 4 that includes the mortgage.  We do not have any debt except the mortgage. We do not feel deprived at all and the most important thing is that I will have an option to choose to work or not, depending on my mood in just 3 years from now.

So you need to decide which pill to take now, **instant gratification or debt free or even more such as Financial Independence**?

"I did the CC + 2 years university thing, and it worked out. I saved a lot of money. However, if money had not been an issue (which it should not be for you with a $55k college fund) I would not have done it this way. Here's why:

Half of college has *nothing to do with classes*. It has to do with community. If you spend four years at a place you will naturally have a *much, much* different experience, socially, than if you are there for two years. At the end of two years you are just beginning to feel the place.

I think attending CC to save money is smart, and admirable, and if you have no interest in investing yourself into your university's social scene then there may not really be a point in spending all four years there. But don't discount the aspects of college that are difficult to get at a community college.

"Landlords don't typically have the ability to put something negative on your credit. Why? Because they aren't providing you with ""credit"". What they are claiming is a LONG way down the road. As in, if they sue you and you don't respond, you will get a default judgment against you, which will ruin your credit.

What you need to do is request proof. Make sure to do so via a letter sent via certified mail. Tell them that if they are able to provide pictures of the damage that required cleaning, and you agree that they are overboard, that you will happy to pay for the cleaning. When they can't provide that proof, they won't be able to prove their claims in a court of law, therefore they have nothing on you. Burden of proof falls on the plaintiff, not the defendant. At the point where they can not provide proof, send them a cease and desist letter, claiming harassment. Send that via certified mail as well, and keep a copy of it for your records. If they contact you again, other than to confirm they've received your cease and desist, SUE THEM IMMEDIATELY.

Whatever you do, be sure to continually communicate in a proper manner. ALWAYS quickly respond to their letters. Do not EVER fail to respond to something. If you are sued, respond to the suit, and file a counter suit claiming harassment, even if you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Just claim that they are harassing you to pay money you do not owe. Log every call, every letter, and every time they say anything to you. No way in hell will they be stupid enough to sue you.

The other question is, have you received any sort of communication from their attorney? If not, they are simply calling your bluff. A serious management company will use a lawyer. The only reason not to use a lawyer is because they know they can't recover that money spent on the attorney. But, if they can squeeze $250 out of you via a $0.47 stamp, that's corporate gold.

Cleaning charges are only warranted if the cleaning is above and beyond normal wear and tear. If you left a bit of gray wear from dirt in the carpet, causing it to need a cleaning, you aren't responsible for that. If you leave them with a carpet that is basically FUCKED, with bong spills, black spots, and cigarette burns, that's your responsibility.

"I want you to pay attention to a few points here: first of all, your girlfriend is bad with money. The student loan debts are common and that doesn't inherently mean she's irresponsible, but the fact she's drowning in pay day loans, and other loans you don't know about mean she needs to be more cautious with her money.

Secondly: she makes enough money that if she weren't being irresponsible, this debt wouldn't even need to become your responsibility. I'm sure your girlfriend is a wonderful person, but she has some serious money issues to sort out.

I think what you need to do at this point is let her deal with her debts herself unless you two are married. They are not your responsibility, and *please* do not take them on. You'll be putting yourself in a very bad situation if a) things don't work out, or b) she continues being irresponsible with money.

What I think you *can* do at this point if you want to be an EXTREMELY nice boyfriend, is let her live with you rent free for a while. She can focus a reasonable $1700-$1800/mo out of her $2000/mo take home towards her debts, and they will slowly but surely get taken down. They are not your responsibility, and you should not pay for any of them unless you are married to her. Which you're not.

I'm not suggesting she's trying to take advantage of you, but I do believe that you can enable her problems if you help her too much, and that can leave you in a much worse spot in the future.",null,null,null,leftpig,null,null,1447706563,t5_2qstm,t3_3t2cd4,t3_3t2cd4,28,1449839333,0,0,cx2gnut,personalfinance,28,null,null

Kicking you out is illegal since you are a minor, also unlawful eviction. Normally if you were an adult you could sue for property damage but since you're a minor your possessions are probably considered your parents' property. It still might be considered an act of violence, psychological abuse, perhaps. I think domestic violence is reserved for couples. Get legal aid, it's free and they can tell you for sure. File a police report, get a restraining order, get emancipated, get a job, go to college, keep in touch with siblings and never speak to the man again. Get into therapy, apply for general assistance (welfare), apply for SSI (disability for minors), get meds, find resources like food banks, shelters, outreach centers, etc. 

I'm guessing you grew up very young and are prone to escapism, hence the videogames. Do yourself a favor and don't start using drugs, it'll burn up all your money and probably for the rest of you life. You will need coping mechanisms though. No one should have to go through this alone. Be super helpful to the people helping you.

Homelessness isn't great but in some significant ways you're free now. Show your father that the school of hard knocks isn't as tyrannical as he was. Live well, never look back.

There are very few banks/credit unions in 2015 that don't allow you to receive a PDF of your statement on your online banking. And no offense intended, but if your bank doesn't offer that service then you should probably close that account and find a more customer service friendly bank.

"You're gonna pay more... you just are.  One way you rent a car, the other, you own it.  

So lets try to compare apples to apples.

A lease Honda Accord LX deal right now is 190/month plus 2 grand at signing.
a new Honda Accord LX is 22000.

So to compare apples to apples, lets do 5 years for both.  car is leased for 5 years or payment plan for 5 years.  One way, you own the car at the end of 5 years and your payment drops to 0.  The other, you keep paying the lease.

Also, you can reduce your insurance cost when you own the car.  You cant do that with a lease.  Because, you don't own it.

Now lets say ""at the end of 5 years I want a new car"".  You turn in the lease, get nothing, and get a brand new car and keep going.

You can sell your 5 year old accord for what kbb estimates is 10 grand ish... 

So you paid 22 grand for the accord purchased, minus 10 grand for sale leave you 12,000 total for the purchased car.
You paid 13400 for the leased car.  And remember your payments have never gone to 0 like they did at the end of the 60 months purchased.  So 61st month you're paying even more...

"Lets be honest... you want a new car and you want a new car often.  Just say it.  You're not going to upset me.

You asked ""why are leases worse than buying""...  we're showing you.  I understand the ""excuses"" of ""maintenance"" ""I'm not handy"" and ""I've gotta have a reliable car""....

Look... all cars need maintance.  There can be lemon cars in purchased or leased.

And you're compring ""renting"" a car for 3 years at the end you paid 7000 and no matter what you gotta go get another car payment, either in the form of another lease or a purchase... or you're 3/5ths of the way through paying for a car you own.

I've bought several cars.. I've never needed to put anything down.  Shop around at another dealership.  0 down, with good credit, should not be hard to find.

The best financial situation is to buy used for cash.  The next best it to buy new at 0% or low interest.  The worst financial decision is to finance and ""rent"" a car.  

That's how it is.  If you want to lease because ""pretty new car"" then lease man.  Remember life changes and if you're stuck with a lease or a job requires you to drive 25,000 miles a year and you gotta blow though your milage limit, that was on you.

"Looks like you started the math, let's finish it.  You've already calculated $6980 as a (near) total cost of ownership for the lease (For the purposes of doing the math I'm excluding tax, title, tags, and maintenance, since they will be the same for both a new car and a lease).  For $21680 you can get a new [Camry XLE](http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/inventorylisting/viewDetailsFilterViewInventoryListing.action?sourceContext=carGurusHomePage_false_0&amp;entitySelectingHelper.selectedEntity=&amp;zip=22042#listing=128561976), so I'll use this car for the example.  If you put $4k down you would be financing $17680.  A 5 year term would be $309.12/mo, so after 3 years you would have spend $4k + 36*309.12 = $15128.

After 3 years it's time to get a new car.  When you turn in the lease you get $0 back, so your full cost for the lease is $6980.  For the other scenario you decide to sell your Camry.  Using pricing for a 2012 as an approximate value for your car in 3 years yields about [$15987](http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2012/Toyota/Camry-4-Cyl/Sedan-4D-XLE/Values) for a private party sale (I split the difference between trade in value and retail to get that number).  In December of 2018 you'll still have $6976.39 to pay off on the car, so if you sell it you'll get cash in hand of approx $9011.  Subtracting the $15128 you've spent so far yields a (near) total cost of ownership of $6116.89.  In this scenario owning is cheaper by about $800.  

If you buy a used car, or hold on to the car for longer than three years, the math works out better in favor of buying, but if you just want a new car every three years leasing make sense since it would free up a couple of grand which could be used for investments and you don't need to spend the time it takes to do a private party sale.

"""Should"" is the operative word there. Bank tellers don't make that much money (I was one in a previous lifetime) and there aren't that many safeguards on preventing a teller from disclosing information they shouldn't be. If the teller or other bank employee knows your mom and just doesn't think about the policy that day, s/he may disclose information they aren't authorized to, especially if you are both customers at the same bank. Going to a new bank that doesn't necessarily know your relationship and can't see that there was or still is a joint account is by far the best course of action - better to prevent the disclosure of information rather than go after the bank for disclosing information they shouldn't have to begin with.

It would also insulate you from the bank trying to recuperate funds from your individual account if the joint account is overdrawn or a transaction posts/deposit is returned to it after it has been closed - I don't know if that would ever become an issue, but again, better safe than sorry. We don't know how the mom will react to her daughter asserting her financial independence and cutting off money that the mom thought she had free access to.

Edit: The reason I mention they don't make that much money is not that I think they can be bought off, but because they aren't necessarily the most highly trained or skilled workers in the world.

"Given the damage you described on the car, you probably want to total it anyways.  Modern cars are designed to deform so the passenger remains safe.  It sounds like your car did it twice in one day.

"I'll jump into the debate right off the bat:  Car repairs are not something that I would recommend using and **emergency** fund for.  Those are expenses that should be anticipated and planned for.  I'm firmly in the camp that believes the *only* thing an emergency fund should be for is (a) an unexpected loss of income or (b) a (**edit:** life &amp; death) medical emergency that, for some reason, isn't covered by insurance.

**Edit:**  I'm getting comments on my comment!  And some of those comments have caused me to contemplate some things, so I thought I'd relay and clarify.

I stand by my job loss &amp; medical life &amp; death use of an emergency fund above.  But it raises the question ""so where does the money for an unexpected car repair, or A/C repair, or flight to see a dying loved one come from""?  In my opinion, those funds should come from wherever it is that you draw money to pay for *any* non-routine expense.  So wherever you draw money from to pay for an extravagant date night, or a weekend hotel, or plane tickets to visit an old friend, or a bridesmaid dress for a wedding or a new Xbox game; that should be the same place that you pull funds from to pay for a new auto windshield, or A/C repair or a flight to see a dying loved one.  Call it the ""non-routine expense fund"".

If you pull money from the non-routine expense fund to buy a windshield, it just means you don't done one of the other more discretionary things that I provided in my list above.  But if you pull money from you emergency fund for a new windshield (or something more expensive like a new A/C unit), and then lose your job a week later, you're kind of fucked.

"Not a tax expert, but some thoughts:

This will likely be treated as income by the IRS. So track every business transaction and expense.

An individual doesn't need a business license to sell items - your company can be a ""sole proprietorship"".

Depending on the sales, you'll likely have a sizable tax bill at the end of the year. This is partially because you'll owe self-employment tax on the business profits, instead of just income tax. The easiest solution to minimize your end-of-year tax bill (and penalties) is to adjust your employers withholding.

"Just do the Roth 401k. I believe you can only do one or the other. The match in a Roth 401k is always taxed like a traditional 401k. It's still contained in your Roth, but the match will be taxable when you take it out after retirement. The reason for this is because a match is always tax deferred. Otherwise, you would have to pay taxes on the match now. So the match and your contributions will grow together, but the portion that is match will be treated like a traditional. It's still worth it to do the Roth now though.

Personally, I'd put up to the match into your Roth 401k and then put the rest into a Roth IRA. The reason for this is because you get more investment options in a Roth IRA and you'll probably be able to invest it better. You can't beat the match though, of course, so start in your 401k.

"My understanding was that you and your wife are both employees.

All employees have taxes withheld from their paycheck based on the W4 form ( https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf ) they submit at the beginning of their employment. You can also contact payroll and request they withhold additional funds.

The reason you want more funds to be withheld is because the IRS (and likely your state) will fine you if you owe too much in taxes at the end of the year (see https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc306.html for details).

So if your employer withholds enough taxes so you're close to enough to what you owe, you won't be fined at the end of the year. You'll also have the side benefit of not having a massive tax bill.

"Modern builders especially building those new shit-tire up in two weeks subdivision homes do such shoddy fucking work too.


The people that did the roof 2 years ago on the house I just bought were a big area roofing company that did a lot of roofs for homes like that.  Here's what's wrong with my brand new roof!


Chimney flashings are resting entirely on top of shingles, there are no head flashings, the flashings are not sealed (tarred or caulked) to the chimney.  This requires the flashing be replaced and the surrounding shingles be torn up, otherwise water will get in around my chimney and leaking will happen.


My ridge vent underneath the plastic vent is only 1/4"" wide, they did not take the time to cut out a proper ridge vent underneath the plastic vent trim.  This requires the entire top rows of my shingles be removed, and the ridge line cut.  THIS PROBLEM HERE CAN COST YOU HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR on cooling costs.  your ridge vent is how hot air gets out of your home in the summer time!


Plumbing vent pip flashings not correctly tucked under shingles where necessary.  these ones did get sealed though.


Shingles were put on with no regards of keeping things straight.  Fucking pull a chalk line and use a tape measure to lay out shingles for christ sake it looks bad when they are not parallel to the roof line, or even eachother....  I'm not fixing this one, just dissapointed.

"When the wife and I got married we had two horrible cats she swore to me were old and short for time on this Earth. They subsequently lived another 13 and 15 years respectively. We had to accommodate these furballs while moving to a new town, and I couldn't find an apartment on the immediate that would take them. So we bought a 5th Wheel trailer. She was a beauty of thin walled aluminum and an oddly coffee cup exterior paint scheme. 31 feet long, slide out, most of a full bath room. The attached kitchen was attached to every other ""room"". We paid a pittance for the trailer after a hail storm had damaged some dealer stock and got her brand new for 13.5K. Lot rent including utilities was 175.00. That made our total housing expenses for the month just a hair north of 300.00.

She was cramped. She flooded a few times in the winter. We didn't even have a truck to move her. I had the old girl delivered to the park I found and set her up myself.

The continued occupancy of the tenants (if lawful) after the foreclosure was under a new contractual arrangement, express or implied, with the new owners."" (PMK v. Folsom Heights)

Basically, you and the new landlord are starting fresh. Negotiate new lease terms with them; they may be flexible given your situation. Or, even better, depending on your location there may not be a surplus of renters. If so, they want keep you around, and you have leverage. 

The part that sucks: your old security deposit is part of a contract with the former, likely insolvent, LL. Contact them and feel out the situation. They should give back the deposit, but they might not. If they don't, try an attorney that isn't going to end up costing more than your deposit and ask her to write a blustery, legal-sounding letter. Good Luck.

"My mom did the same thing. I was a minor and she had maxed out cards in my name. I tried going through the above mentioned channels on my own, and seemed to be stuck in an endless loop.

In high school the Credit Bureaus said they couldn't find a credit file on me (because it was my moms name but my number), after I told them what happened, they locked my credit. The banks couldn't open any accounts for me because when they ran their checks it came back as someone else. I had to wait two weeks for them to manually open checking/savings accounts for me instead of using their electronic systems. At this point we submitted written notices to the credit bureaus as requested for the second time. No response. I didn't want to file a police report, because, you know, its my mom.. I kinda just ignored it while in college. 

Fast forward 5 years. Graduated from college. Got a job at a subsidiary of said bank. Issue came up when they were performing credit check. They had me go to the Social Security Admin. and explain it to them. I brought my Social Security Card, Birth Certificate, License, and Passport. I had to prove that I was me. They printed me off a piece of paper signed by them that agreed that I am me (wtf?). The bank then had me fax that to their internal fraud department that forwarded it along to their contacts at the credit bureaus. About a week later they left me a voicemail saying everything had been cleared from my credit history and that I would need to begin rebuilding credit. Turns out, not only did mother dearest have a few credit cards in my name, some 60 year old guy in Virginia had bought a boat. 

This was like September of last year when it was all said and done. Currently building credit. Secured Credit Card &amp; Secured Loan. Then an Amazon Store Card when I was eligible and I just switched from the Secured Card to a ""big boy"" card. I'm only at a 673 right now, but I'm just happy that I have it all taken care of. 

That turned out to be a lot longer of a response than I was expecting.

"Once upon a time (i.e., 1970s and earlier), income taxes were very high, but corporate taxes were low (much like Europe is today).  So, if a company offered an executive a 20% raise, they exec might only see 5% extra in their paycheck, and taxes would take the rest.  

So, companies got creative.  Instead of giving raises, they gave ""perks"".  The company car is the most famous one, but there were others.  Free use of corporate vacation property, free country club memberships, corporate housing, etc...  Sometimes, companies just looked the other way when people would put personal purchases on their company credit card.   

When Regan changed the tax law, he tried to close these loop holes as part of the compromise to lower personal taxes.  

1. Corporate tax rate was set ~= to the personal tax rate, a huge raise.
2. Fringe benefits became taxable (or at least the IRS started going after them).  

So, instead of the company offering to let the ""C"" level executive use the corporate jet on the weekend, they'll just throw them a few hundred thousand dollars more in salary.   The cost to the company / employee is the same, and the taxes are easier.

But, as the IRS go after big companies for fringe benefits, the middle class gets caught in ways that weren't intended.  The IRS has even been know to go after individuals for taxes on the cash value of their frequent flyer miles they get from work travel.  Now, I don't think that's what Regan intended in the 80s, but that's what's happening today.

"After being burned on my 1st apartment, I took pictures pre and post lease on my 2nd.  When I moved out, I took video evidence of me doing a 'white glove' test of everything-  fan blades, using windex on the windows, full pictures of the carpet throughout, and pictures behind and under every appliance (they were easy to pull out from the wall)... followed by me driving to the leasing office and handing in my key. Everything was spotless.  Like... ""pass military inspection"" spotless.  There was 1 hour of video... and most of it unbroken.  

They sent me an itemized invoice for some sketchy cleaning service that said I left the apartment a mess.  They had to replace the blinds.  I replaced the blinds a day before I left-  because I broke a couple of slats.  They invoiced me for patching nail holes. I never put a nail in the wall.  They had pictures of cockroaches behind the stove.  I had video of a pristine area behind the stove. They said I had animal urine everywhere and they needed to replace the carpet. I never had an animal in the apartment.

At the time, I had transitioned into a consultant position for environmental compliance.  My office was billing $1200 per day for my work (I only got like 1/4th of that).

When they sent the tab, I immediately went to our legal group and showed them about 3 minutes of my video and the claim from the leasing agency.  I got a nice letter with *my* daily rate invoice on the company letterhead.  I took a day off and took my evidence and the letter to the leasing office.  I informed them that the letters they sent were obviously fraudulent and I would be happy to see them in court.

Suddenly there was a 'mistake' and it must have been the wrong apartment.  With some moderate *suggesting* they cut me a check for deposit AND my daily invoice rate.

"My advice is to contact a CPA. It may cost you one or two grand, but they will be able to sort this out with a lot less headache than if you do it yourself. Include your sister in any discussions regarding this, because you may not be able to transfer this income to yourself, and if that is the case then you will need the CPA's advice on next steps. 

That said, I'll make a couple of suggestions on how to start taking care of this on your own. You've made this fairly complex for yourself, but there are a few initial steps you'll need to take regardless.

First, get your bank records together for the account which received the Paypal transfers.    
Second, get the Paypal account transaction detail - if the account is closed, banned, or otherwise inaccessible, contact Paypal to see if you can get verification of those transfers being made to your account. If it's in your sister's name, you'll need to loop her in on the request to Paypal as they won't release it to you.    
Third, if you don't have reasonable accounting records, get started on them.    

She'll likely need to amend her income tax return in the end (it's simpler to show it passing through as revenue/expense on Schedule C than it is to ""transfer the income"" to you). You will likely need to amend your return to show that additional revenue.",null,null,null,TheMoatGoat,null,null,1447806851,t5_2qstm,t3_3t89ut,t3_3t89ut,80,1449865245,0,0,cx3yi6g,personalfinance,80,null,null

"One thing the IRS considers is intent. From the facts provided, it would appear to most people and will probably appear to the IRS that you did not simply make a good faith mistake, but were instead purposefully evading taxation, and if we're being frank, you committed identity theft. When you have a situation in which a taxpayer made a good faith mistake the IRS is often lenient in abating penalties and setting up a payment plan if the taxpayer cannot afford their back taxes. However, you're on the other side of the IRS when it has the appearance of willful misconduct.

Of course, if your sister is a saint, she could work with the IRS as if it were her that under-reported her tax liability, and you could pay her privately, without the IRS knowing of your involvement, so that the situation could have the pretense of an honest mistake.

"This is not true at all.  They certainly have records of where the money came from, it just may be a real bitch to figure out.  But if he gets an email from some branch manager that says, yeah we don't know where it came from, that is not the golden ticket to the money.  

OP is fully aware that the money is not his, and he did not deposit it.  Spending the money, without allowing for a proper investigation, would be fraud.  

If it were me, I would seek a counsel, and see what the best course of action is.  If he loses the money, and he did not make the bank jump through a bunch of hoops fighting to keep it, the bank would likely be liable for the attorney's fees (they should be minimal if the bank is able to figure it out) 

I would think that it wouldn't be unreasonable to withdraw the money, and put it into a bank account with a different bank, and not touch it.  This way the bank cannot simply say they found the mistake, take the money, and add it to their coffers until they figure it out.  This would serve many functions, as a withdrawal that large would certainly be flagged, and the investigation would accelerate, in addition to protecting your own interests.  

The other option would be to withdraw whatever other money is in that account, and just let it sit for a long time.  There must be some sort of statute of limitations, and if they don't take the money, or notify OP, than it would be his.

In any case if he wants to try to keep the money, I would seek an attorney.  If he really just wants to give the money back, I would call the bank's corporate office, speak to some sort of supervisor, record the conversation (disclose that it is being recorded under wire tapping laws), and conduct as much correspondence as possible through email, so that there is a record.

"&gt;Going home for Thanksgiving to find a letter from the IRS stating I owe $9,000+ by Dec 9th is a lot of fun.

Man, you're not kidding. Oh, wait... 

&gt;I contacted Social Security to find out what happened... and then I learned I had about $50,000 just waiting for me.

Oh, you got a big payout. This is a bit different than just getting a ""You owe $9000"" letter. It's a tax on money you received. So you're not, like, paying this out of your pocket. Whew, that's a little more manageable.

&gt;The following tax season, I was using the free version of TurboTax and one of the questions is something like ""Did you receive any money from SS, how much?"" Well, when I put in $50,000, my meter shot up and said I owed $8,000. I thought to myself, ""Well this can't be right, because it doesn't even ask about the specifics, and the Social Security man said this money wasn't taxable."" So, I deleted that input and filed my taxes.

So you were handed $50K, you didn't actually do any due diligence on whether you owed taxes on it, and when online tax prep software *told* you that there were taxes owed, you ignored it *for another three years*. Sound financial planning, young man.

&gt;It sucks, because my father was murdered and now I feel like I'm paying taxes because he was murdered.

No, you're paying taxes on a government payout. The reason for the payout notwithstanding, you received a large amount of money in a form that is taxable, and you ignored that for several years. You now owe taxes on that payout. Fortunately, since you invested it instead of spending it (smart thinking), you have that money sitting there-- and probably a larger amount now, because in 3 years, $50K does accumulate some decent interest-- so when you pay the taxes you owe, you'll probably have more than you would have if you had just paid the tax right away.

&gt;Is losing my dad and having my whole life changed not taxing enough?

It sure is pretty rough, and if that was as far as it went, then sure. But you also got $50K. And even after you pay the taxes on the money you were *given* you still have $41K left.

Audit your automatic recurring expenses (e.g. Netflix, cell phones, etc.).  Cancel *any* recurring service you don't need and *immediately* put that savings into a Roth IRA.  Any service you need you need to call the provider, threaten to cancel, and demand a reduction of costs.  $10 / $20 in reductions per service will make the difference in retirement savings.

"I would start thinking long term in terms of where you see yourself in 5-10 years. Is the SF lifestyle something that you can't imagine leaving behind? Is it a phase that you are trying to get out of your system before you settle down? Do you want to get married (and when)? Do you want kids? If you do, do you want to raise them in a 2BR condo? You are making a 5 year plan but maybe you haven't thought about how much your life could change in those 5 years (especially since you are in that age bracket where things could take a turn very quickly). 

The reason why I say you should think about all these things is because I am in a similar situation - similar age, NYC, similar pay. I am quickly realizing that I love NYC and I don't want to leave, but that I will have to. So, I am trying to live it up as much as I can now, enjoy everything NYC has to offer, so in a couple of years I can move to a lower COL area and never look back. I will never be able to afford anything in NYC, no matter how much money I make, and nor do I want to. Why spend $750k on a 2BR apt when I can buy a nice house for $150k in the midwest.

"&gt; The “tempting” strategy, which is appealing for instant gratification reasons is, pay off the 401K loan and HELOC leaving about 100K left. Sell the condo, and make about 100K profit. Take the 200K+ and just payoff my entire mortgage on my home. Done, I own it outright. This would free up about $1700 a month I can then invest, put in college savings, whatever we want. Would also put us in a considerably better position if I ever lost my job to not have a mortgage.  
  

Money is pretty cheap right now at 3-4%.  You may be better off putting your inheritance in risk-adverse investments.  I'd suggest asking a close friend or wealthy relative for an introduction to his/her financial adviser, and have a meeting with the adviser to find out what he/she thinks.  
  
Edit:  
Your condo will likely continue to increase in value, especially if it is in a high-demand area.  Furthermore, if it is fairly developed (little room for new build).  
  
Does your rental income pay for your mtg + expenses?  Interest and Deprecriation (on your Sched E of your personal tax return - if you want to get detailed and look for that page) are deductions, and can be tax benefits.  While on paper your taxes might show you taking a loss on the rental property, add back depreciation which isn't a real use of cash, and see how it affects that number.  
  
If you can keep someone in that condo and they are essentially paying for your mortgage, that's beautiful.  You mentioned paying off the mtgs and investing the ~1700.  The amount of time it will take you to accumulate 150K (your inheritance) is 7.5 years.  So that's 7.5 years wasted of the 150K you could have been investing *today*.

"I have been advocating for the Myanmar market for a couple of years now. The World Bank expects the Myanmar GDP to reach 10% growth this year (about 8.5% last year), so you can just invest in the market and make money. Roughly 90% of the country is agrarian, so there is little downside risk, since the only place they have to go is up.

They are next door to China, and are a huge trading partner, since Myanmar has enough natural resources to keep China going for a long time.

For Americans, this is a virtual NO RISK, HIGH REWARD investment. Such things are not supposed to exist, but the US government offers its citizens risk insurance when they invest in Myanmar (hence it is virtual, since frontier markets are very high risk, but that risk is removed with insurance backed by the US government).

Right now, the best plays are moving precious stones out of the country (if you are from the US or EU, this is prohibited, but it's OK to do if you are from a country where your government does not have sanctions against Myanmar). Some friends are making $1M a month doing this part-time (i.e., two weekend trips a month). There is a housing shortage there, so real estate is a very safe play--especially if you rent housing to expats (but note: buying luxury property outright is not a good play right now).

There are a few funds working in Myanmar that are doing well. The Myanmar stock market is also coming on line sometime this year or next, so look out for that, too. What you want to do is find companies that can get deals done in Myanmar (a lot of people complain about not being able to do business there, but that's because they don't take time to learn how the system works there) and can be trusted. Not an easy task, but they exist--and you'll be rewarded for the effort (like all investments).",null,null,null,MistaSchlong,null,null,1448828632,t5_2qstm,t3_3uqn9q,t3_3uqn9q,-2,1450105236,0,0,cxh2p6b,personalfinance,-2,null,null

"Your tempting strategy should be called your ""safe""  strategy.  And your ""smart""  strategy should be called your ""business"" strategy.  

I won't go into alot of detail, but I would think of it like this.  Can you make more money in the long run using that 150k on other investments assuming there are no speed bumps along the way(job loss,  economic meltdown where condos are almost worthless and hard to rent out) ? Yes, although there are alot more risks involved. It's a business move as there aren't any guaranteed results out of it. 

You have a job which isn't 100% secure,  your wife doesn't have a job, and your wanting another kid.  Do you really want to throw a business risk into the equation?

 I personally would want to pay off the house I bought to solidify for almost a 100% fact that my family will grow up stable due the lack of bills and pure saving of money.  Also you would be saving a tremendous amount of money off interest on those loans. 

Condo's are risky business though, and no matter what you do, I would 100% sell it at the current profit you are at.  If you want to own something that pays the mortgage on its self and maybe some (which is very smart)  then get a home rental as they are more sought after and don't fluctuate with the economy like the condo does.

"When it comes to splitting the assets, it's going to come down quite simply to who has a name on the title/deed/debt.  Creditors don't care what the verbal agreements were to parents, or how you guys split up your expenses, or what's 'fair' in terms of splitting debt and equity.

Assuming you both split and move to apartments/family, you'll both still be on the hook for your joint debts/ownership of assets.  Either person can ""buy out"" the other by signing a quit-claim, which could be tied to either a financial agreement (ie you buy out his half of the land you guys own, or you give up your equity in exchange for him assuming part of your student line of credit), one of you walks away (ie just signs the quit claim and gives debt and assets to the other), or, one of you forces a sale (meaning neither one wants to walk away and you can't come to an agreement on the assets/debts, in which case going through the court a sale would be forced and you'll both end up splitting what's likely to be a loss based on your info).  

Your local laws may vary on the financial details of what I just listed out, but there's a few things to keep in mind regardless:

- You are the owner of the 25k of student credit debt.  He has no legal obligation to this debt.
- His parents have no legal claim to any money from either of you, although they could probably go to small claims court.  Due to the amount though, the cost/benefit likely isn't worth it, especially considering even if they win they can't just get a lump sum payment, as no one has it
- The 2.5 acre lot and the 'tiny house' is jointly owned by both of you.  Who paid what is irrelevant unless it goes to court to have one or the other buy out the equity or force a sale.
- Your current incomes, from a legal perspective, are irrelevant in terms of how assets will be divided in a legal situation.

Advice?  Get an apartment or move in with family, but keep the families OUT of your discussions.  Sort the financial details out later, but be willing to walk away from your equity in these assets in exchange for his assumption of the debt with them.  Dragging this out further is not going to do anything but become a nightmare...this is one of those know when to fold them situations that you learn from in the future.  Cut ties with his family, the relationship, and the assets of this situation.

Having gone through a very similar situation, I would also suggest not blindsiding the guy.  Unless there's a legitimate fear of violence or damage to your stuff, etc, or there's zero chance of having a conversation, discussing your feelings about your living situation, what you want to do, and why you want to do it, would be appreciated by him long term, whether he admits it or not.  He'll likely feel blindsided and unaware that things were trending poorly for some time and that you just 'up and left' without trying to fix or discuss anything.  While you've had time to think about these things and reach the conclusions and decisions you're now getting to, he has likely not done the same.  He may not be aware of it, and may have told himself they were arguments and not something more significant.  Take the assets, the debts, the parents on both sides...all of it out of the talk, and just discuss why you want to leave, and give him a chance to mentally come to terms with it.  Moving out while he's out of town (or in my case, while I was at work) was, in my opinion, a less than ideal way to handle the situation, and created a tone of bitterness and competition to ""get over"" on the other person that could've been avoided if things were handled in a better fashion.  That could easily cascade into a drawn out legal fight and cost money and certainly add stress to your situation.

 Again, this wouldn't apply if there's an actual danger here, and I don't have specifics on the long term trend of the relationship, it's just what I've come away with from my own experiences as a hockey playing dude that was in a funky financial situation after a less than stellar ending to a relationship that just happened to involve a newly purchased home.",null,null,null,ciabattabing16,null,null,1447430872,t5_2qstm,t3_3sngvf,t3_3sngvf,29,1449779334,0,0,cwyzclx,personalfinance,29,null,null

"It still sounds like he 'manipulated' her into *him* paying $10k in down payment and then splitting the remaining cost equally. Land that she wants to keep and somehow buy him out (though where the money for that would come I don't see) so she does see it as valuable too. When someone pressed her on the abuse she said 'well he hasn't been but he's verbally abusive' which is a real thing but also not quite what she's selling at the beginning.

&gt;The reason you pay an insurance company is so they can reimburse your for expenses caused by and accident

If you do look in your policy you do have a deductible, and surprisingly enough your carrier or your agent will not just eat this upfront before they have even contacted the other carrier. They have to take care of your vehicle first or at least start the process (which involves cutting you a check) before they can just go after the other carrier. Your local agency legit made one phone call on your behalf, since you pay their salary and all, to notify the other carrier and start the process for you.

&gt;If your insurance agent tells you not to report an accident to them, then they aren't doing their job properly.

"Your state has rules about what happens if he dies without a will -- intestate. If your father understands that probate might cost some money and thus reduce the size of the estate, there's not much more you can do. You can't force him to write a will or take steps to put some of his assets into vehicles that pass to you two outside of probate.

However, one thing you could do is suggest he create a notebook where he presents all the information about his various accounts, where they are, passwords, etc. There are estate planning workbooks with advice about this. Also, sites like www.getyourshittogether.org. If he's leery about the sensitivity of this info, maybe ask that he keep some of this in a safe deposit box that you and he have access to.

"So the first question is if said investments have beneficiaries?  This would override a will. If you can't bring up the topic this is going to be hard to find out.  However it is important.  If every time he sets something up he only uses your sister, you are SOL :P   Lets hope that isn't the case.  

If you are the only two sisters, and you get along, chances are it won't be that big of a deal.  A lawyer will handle most of the work.  The real loss will be in paying the lawyer &amp; locating the assets.  

More important then a will, is a asset list that is complete. Too often is the case people don't even know what assets they need to claim.  

If you two are the only two heirs you could have a will drawn up and present it to him for signing.  Just a very simple document or and maybe better, a living trust.  

Then we aren't so much talking about death, but protecting assets. Living trusts have a number of pro's and cons.  I don't know why lawyers like them so much but they are often oversold. However for particularly large estates they are often the best fit.  Just ensure that the trust has a plan for dissolving the trust and splitting the assets. Too often these things are worded with the intention of lasting forever.  Which maybe something you want, but just make sure it can be dissolved and that how that is supposed to happen is clearly worded.  

Really, the best prep step here though is to talk to estate lawyer.  Also, seriously consider the possibility that your father has left everything to charity and is deflecting the topic.  This happens quite often and the heirs are often left in the dark on purpose.   I used to be a IT consultant and had a number of financial firms as clients. I was privy to a large amount of private information.  Obviously I can't be specific, but I can assure you with large estates it's more often that heirs don't know what's happening, then do.  Sometimes they are mislead on purpose, sometimes kept in the dark, etc.  In short, don't count on that money.  It could be going to charity, Charity, or a housekeeper he particularly likes, etc.  ",null,null,null,DangoDemolisher,null,null,1447352766,t5_2qstm,t3_3sk730,t3_3sk730,31,1449761233,0,0,cwxxqed,personalfinance,31,null,null
"Dream 401k:

- No account maintenance fees (paid by company). These fees suck. They can amount to huge percentages for small balances. No Bueno.

- Match paid as employee contributes (lets say you offer a $1 for $1 match up to 3%, and the employee hits 3% of their salary in terms of contribution by March, the company match is already contributed for the year). This allows front-loading.

- High Match. This will attract and retain people.

- Automatic enrollment/Safeharbor contribution. This will help attract/retain higher-paid professionals since it gets around the high-income limitation.

- No vesting. This will help attract workers.

- Better fees than you can get in an IRA. Because fees suck ;).

- Good index fund options. This is a no-brainer.

- Day 1 start. Helps attract people.

- EDIT (missed this one): In-service rollovers. This allows the mega-backdoor Roth as well as a loophole for getting around crappy funds.

"Eyeball it looks fine except for 3 items.

* What is the insurance on (its 180)
* Do you have a car and how much is it/Do you owe on it
* What is your student loan amount.

I used overstock to buy alot of my starter apartment furniture as it was better quality than ikea and they shipped the heaviest things for like a dollar.  Fully furnished a apartment for about 3k (couch, bedroom set, livingroom set, bed, kitchen table, etc).  Take handmedowns whenever you can find them.

I'd offer a bit of advice.. if you have debt of any kind... pay them off.  A mistake alot of people make once they break past the poverty line their family has been under is to try to rotate debt in this unending spiral.  The best way to deal with debt.. is to never get any.

If you truly want to stand out from your family and be the success you are... don't make the mistakes they made, that includes how they handle debt.  The credit card is not for emergencies... loans are not a good thing.... don't lease or rent a car.  Stay away from gimmicks like timeshares, partnerships, buying homes with girlfriends and not a wife, taking your 401k or roth in order to downpayment a home, etc.

The best way to build wealth is to build it slowly, and the best way to build it is with an unencumbered income.  An unencumbered income is one that has no monthly payments attached to it sucking up 1/4 to 1/2 of it.

If you have student loans, pay them off.  If you have car loans, pay them off.  If you want a house, save up A TON of cash AFTER you pay off your debts in total. 

Your budget looks fine... but factor in any and all debts you have and look at them as the spawn of satan, here to take all your wealth and earning potential and drag you back down below the bar you fought so hard to climb past.

"Get something less than 500$ and don't even look at a Mac. Most laptops start to have problems after 2-3 years so there isn't much point sinking 1-2k into one. No macs because even though apple loves to make their fans fanatics, they're actually only good for the screen and the touchpad, which doesn't justify a 1200 price increase from a normal laptop (*especially* not if you're a college student who just got your pc stolen). Here's what to look for when purchasing a PC, in terms of what it actually does.


GPU: you're going to want around 2gb of memory on your gpu. This is what powers the loading of graphical software and your screen. Basically; it's what you see.



CPU: you're going to want something that isn't totally useless, so 1.7Mhz minimum. This is what loads processes and renders data. It's essentially what places the buildings on the map.


RAM: 4gb is great. 2 is okay. This essentially is overflow loading power. It's short term memory that erases once the pc is off.


Everything else is entirely optional, but you should be able to find a pc with 4gb of ram, decent processing power, and 2gb GPU for around 500$. However; if all you're doing is writing papers or something that requires the most basic of PC needs, then just get a surface or something for like 200$.

Yep. The priority is to kill CC debt as soon as possible. I want to allocate $X to pay it down each month but it needs to be a meaningful amount. But even if I swing $500/mo across the 3 cards it still wont be paid off before the 0% expires.

"you said ""Due to a bad check he wrote me a month ago""

you are now golden!

its a civil matter to not pay your employees, and that could take months or years to get action taken on (and with a bankruptcy or similar trick, your boss could possibly walk away scott free, and pay you nothing)

but here is the good part (for you).  writing a bad check (unlike simply not paying someone) is a whole different animal (legally speaking)  writing a bad check is a CRIMINAL OFFENSE.  in writing you that bad check, he has committed a crime!!! and you are the one who has the power over whether or not you want to press charges.  All you have to do it take the bounced check to the police station (or with today's electronic banking, similar proof - although it you can get the hardcopy of the bounced check, thats always best).  When you get to the police station, ask to talk to someone about pressing charges, and they will arrest him.

granted, they might not send out a cop to arrest him on the spot (although, its possible they might).  but they will contact him, or send him something to turn himself in, or sometimes they'll just issue a bench warrant and wait for him to cross paths with law enforcement.  if he doesn't immediately turn himself in, there will be a warrant out  for him, and next time he gets pulled over, or jaywalks, etc, he will be thrown right into jail, probably have to spend the night, and then will have to go before a judge.  depending upon whether a deal is made, or not, he will have a criminal trial (or will have to plea - which will almost always have as a condition that he pay the victim).

this exact thing happened to me.  I had a boss who was WAY behind in his payments, and (luckily he did write me one check that bounced - the other checks were not even issued to me)  I took the bounced check to the police in NYC, they didn't go after him (its a low-priority crime), but he was pulled over a month later for some minor driving offense, they cop saw the criminal warrant out for him, and he was thrown right into jail.   he had a real prosecutor go after him, and the prosecutor worked out a deal, pay the bounced check (and the other back pay, to me, in cash) and the charges would be dropped.  given the choice of having a criminal record, and serving time to jail... or paying me the money he owed me, he paid me (its amazing how, no matter how broke someone claims to be, if they are about to go to jail, they seem to magically be able to come up with the money they need to pay you).

as such, in your situation, do NOT tell him what you're about to do in advance, but do go to the police, fill out the paperwork to press charges, ask the cops you give it to to press charges, and THEN go to him with that paperwork, and let him know.

if you are lucky, he'll pay you then and there (insist upon ALL of your back pay to withdraw the criminal complaint). 
he might be like your average joe, and not even know what a big deal (legally) writing a bad check is, so he might want to check with his lawyer (thats fine, his lawyer will let him know that he's in some hot water now!).  Just make sure, if he does offer to pay you, do NOT withdraw the charges, or sign anything!!! until you have been paid ALL of the money he owes you.  He might try to weasel out of it by offering you less than he owes, but don't do it.  You are all that stands between him and a criminal record, and quite possibly him going to jail,  you are in a strong position, a position to get what you are owed!

If he doesn't want to pay you then, no worries, you can just sit back and wait, sooner or later, he'll get pulled over for something, and bam-bang-boom, he'll be sent to jail on the spot (thats what happened when you have an active warrant out for you).  that kind of thing will wake him up, and get him to pay.  he might not even get as lenient a prosecutor as my old boss got, your boss might be required to pay you back AND do some jail time.

point being, to your average person, bouncing a check is no big deal, we shrug it off, but the law takes writing bad checks seriously, VERY seriously, especially if its paycheck, or there is ANY indication at all, that it was done with the knowledge that there was insufficient funds to cover that check.

either way, from the point of view of the law, writing bad checks is A BIG DEAL, and it is something **they will prosecute**.  especially if the victim can show they were hurt by the check bouncing (which you can do without a doubt).

so, take that check, run (don't walk) to your nearest police station, and get this scumbum arrested (or at the very least, get your $$$)

"startups in general are full of people who make bad decisions for what they think are the right reasons. about a year ago a project I was working on was acquired by an extremely successful startup (claimed to have 20 million in profit in the first year (red flag one)). Now they outright bought the project from me and took me on board to manage it so I had very little reason to doubt their success, but things in the office started to get weird and I started having my bullshit meter go off the charts.

first I noticed nobody in the office worked.. ever. the boss always had them playing league of legends or dicking around doing anything but working on the systems they should have been.

then the boss started to brag about all the cars he was buying and how he hopes by lending his secretary a lot of money, she will start sleeping with him (what..)

then on the eve of acquiring another project suddenly the office was a ghost town and me and the secretary were the only ones to show up. The CEO texted me and causally asked me to sign this 5 million pound agreement for the project and they would sort it out later as for whatever reason he couldn't be there. I straight up told him there was no way in hell I'm signing anything. (at this point I had worked for this company for 2 weeks).

they convinced the secretary to sign (even though I warned her many many times that it was a bad idea). The next day the CEO called me into his office and fed me this ""you aren't really acting like a team player in this small team"" bullshit speech about how startups operate. I told him then that I will no longer be working for them and to not even bother sending me my first paycheck as I want to be in no way associated with them, and promptly left the office.

about a month later the CEO was arrested for securities fraud and embezzlement, last I heard he ended up receiving a 10+ year sentence in the UK and other countries were looking to extradite him afterwards. The Secretary also had some repercussions for signing that document as the CEO somehow managed to resell their project without ever paying them for it, then tried to escape the country with those funds (which is when he was caught). think because the agreement was in her name, they had to go after her for the 5 million pounds for the deal and she had to sue the CEO to recover the money.

if I was a slightly more desperate, naive person, I may have totally fallen for the ""look we are going to be making so much money, and you are jumping on board before we take off, so just do us a solid and we will remember it"" line. Kids these days are desperate for success and don't realize how easy targets they make.

"&gt; The next day the CEO called me into his office and fed me this ""you aren't really acting like a team player in this small team"" bullshit speech about how startups operate.

Oh man, reading this gave me minor PTSD. I got my start in the software business helping out my brother, who had gone into business for himself about a year prior. I worked for him remotely for a while and eventually moved near him to work with him full-time.

Now, we were both fairly typical web dev guys: good at technical stuff, not so good at the interpersonal client relationship stuff. Most of our work came from one large client, but this was around the time the economy started declining and the work from our big client declined right along with it. We made some forays at finding other clientele, with limited success. Then my brother met this guy, the A-type outgoing sales kind of guy. He seemed like a decent enough dude, and so we started working together.

Now, this whole time, I was working as a contractor, first for my brother's company, and later from Sales Guy's company. Eventually, I began to realize that, like many Type As, this guy could flip from jovial and endearing to tyrannical asshole at the drop of a hat. Moreover, while there was more work with him finding clients, it was still pretty limited.

There was one time that we were working on a prototype internal project that he wanted to market to local businesses. It came down to day before he had a meeting scheduled to demo the prototype to some interested people, and I was still trying to hunt down bugs. As the afternoon wore on, it became obvious that I wasn't going to have this thing in a good demo state by 5:00. Sales Guy came by, asked how it was going, and then asked if I could stay late and wrap things up. I sort of sighed and said I would. He, in turn, looked slightly taken aback.

A few minutes later, he came back by and asked if we could talk for a second. He told me he was a little concerned, because when he asked if I'd work late, I didn't seem too happy about it. Of course I'm not happy about it, I have other stuff I'd rather be doing. I straight-up told him, ""Look, if your expectation is for me to work late and be giddy about it, you're going to be disappointed. If your expectation is for me to get the job done, then you'll be satisfied.""

It was around this time that I started seriously looking for a real job, something where I could have dependable income instead of irregular contract pay. It was a good call, because around the beginning of the next year, the work really dried up. Since I had so little to do, I'd generally show up at his house (where we worked) around 11, and even then I'd rarely have enough actual work to keep me busy until, say, 5. One day, I was on my way over and Sales Guy called me. He was freaking out because he decided to try and change the banner image on a client site and he fucked it up because he had no business doing this. I assured him that I'd be there in about five minutes and I'd take care of it.

It was an easy fix, and I went to let him know when it was done. He thanks me and then said, ""Next time you're going to be late like that, let me know."" I replied that I'd been showing up at the same damn time for past month, and he reluctantly agreed.

This precipitated what I think of as The Big Meeting a couple days later. He called us all together and started blathering about how the economy was crappy and we should all feel very fortunate to have work. Then he moved on to how we all needed to make sacrifices to keep the business going. Finally, he got to the meat of the thing: we all needed to be at work no later than 9:30 every morning, ready to go. I'm not generally a confrontational type, but I had to say it. ""If I have to be here at 9:30 every morning, does that mean you're going to pay me for all the time I'm here, regardless of whether or not I have actual work to do?""

Hoo boy. He did not like that at all. He told me again that I should be happy to have work, and if I didn't like it, I could always go back to restaurant kitchen work or just go into business for myself, because ""he sure didn't know of anyone else that was hiring.""

About two weeks later, I accepted a full-time job offer and gave that man the most satisfying resignation notice of my entire life.

His point about making sacrifices for the business isn't necessarily invalid, but if you want me to do that, then you need to make me some kind of stakeholder instead of just a contractor.

"Hi, late to the party, but I own a dealership. A lot of people have said that you're required to show insurance before leaving the dealer's lot or taking possession of the vehicle. This depends on the state that you reside in. In Texas, you can purchase a vehicle without proof of insurance or a driver's license - it is up to the leinholder to have insurance worked out for their asset on the road. This was a rule that changed recently (within the last 5 years?). 



Second, if it was a BHPH, the leinholder is the actual lot. In this case, it is much different. She likely signed paperwork that said she has to keep full-coverage on the vehicle at all times or face repossession. Either the lot screwed up and didn't cover the car with insurance, or we're missing some part of the story.



Third, most lots will have a ""garage policy"" or an ""open lot"" policy, which can cover vehicles on test drives or the like. The lot can very likely get the value of the car back from an insurance company regardless of if the other driver has insurance or not. 



Lastly, possible outcomes: I'd say that your worst case scenario is the down payment is gone and she'll default on the note - with less money and another hard life lesson learned. You could also look up the state regulations for BHPH lots and then see where they screwed up. If they're willing to admit fault (unlikely) you could possibly get the down payment back. I've had buddies of mine in the exact same situation (sold a car to someone without insurance, person goes and totals the car before they get insurance, and then tries to go after the dealership that let them drive off the lot without insurance), and it didn't go over well for the consumer. This case is different because it was a BHPH and the car was out on a note - so they're going to be much more willing to work with you.

"I work in a call center for retirement plans. You could try an annuity. There are 3 main types, fixed, fixed index, and variable. A fixed annuity is basically a savings account with no involvement in the stock market whatsoever. You have a Guaranteed Minimum Interest Rate(GMIR) which varies based on the specific plan, but doesn't usually go higher than 3% because, low risk.  
  
Now a variable annuity is heavily based in the stock market, and if it goes down the year you have to start taking money out, you're SOL. But there's definitely possibility to earn a lot of money off it.  
  
Now the fixed index annuity is kind of a ""best of both worlds"" plan almost. Your money is allocated into stocks, but you're guaranteed to at least get back what you pay into it. If you do end up earning money, say the market is doing well, you get to cash that out, but if the market crashes, and your 400k turns into 50 bucks, you're still getting 400k back.

"I had a similar case, landlord tried to keep my whole security deposit in Texas, I think it was $1400. We had repaired things originally broken and left the place in great shape. The landlord was in California and used a local management company. When we asked him what the charges were for he stated items like cracks in the ceiling, leaky water faucet outside, door replaced due to damage from the dog and tears in the linoleum. The linoleum damage was true, but was caused by a previous tenet and was listed in the walk through. I pointed this out and 3 times they changed what the charges were for but always the same exact total of our deposit. The door portion was a flat out lie. When we moved out the next tenet was waiting outside to move in, there was no walkthrough they took the property from us directly. I asked them about it later and found out the management company was giving them problems and they were happy to write a letter to the JP to state the condition we left it in and that the door was original and undamaged.

They tried to give me half after I filed, but at that point I was ready to fight. The landlord actually flew out to fight it, and got reamed by the JP for not letting the court know he needed a translator since he only spoke Chinese. He made a very large color photo of the tear in the linoleum which the JP asked if I wanted to see, I didn't as I wasn't disputing items in my walkthrough since we didn't cause them. He provided a handwritten invoice for the charges that came from the manager's brother in law. (I knew this and pointed it out to the JP since the BIL had done a repair while we lived there) Was a very easy win and they actually paid it quickly.

- You must have paid student loan interest during the calendar year you are doing your taxes for.

- To claim the credit, you must not be claimed as an exemption on anyone else's tax return and you must not be filing as married filing separately.

- The student loan must have been used to pay for qualified educational expenses.

- The most student loan interest you can claim as a deduction is $2,500 or the amount you paid in student loan interest during the calendar year, whichever is smaller.

- You do not have to itemize to claim this deduction, which makes this much easier and more likely to be used.

- There are MAGI requirements for claiming the deduction:

Or alternatively, is he unable to find a comparable job in Sacremento? He could afford a significant drop in salary from Dropping cost of flights alone. 

I'm not trying to tell this person don't do your current job, I'm mainly just confused why he's working in a far away city and the employer isn't paying for travel, or why he can't just move to LA.
